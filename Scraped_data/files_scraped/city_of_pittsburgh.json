Love Your Wild Neighbor Public Service Announcement Video Baby Fawns Public Service Announcement Video Coyotes Public Service Announcement Video Love Dogs & Cats Public Service Announcement Video Description of Services: The Bureau of Animal Care & Control provides assistance to Bureaus within the Department of Public Safety, other City Departments and the Allegheny County Health Department in situations involving animals, both domestic and wild. The Bureau enforces City and State codes dealing with animals; issues citations and appears in court; helps to keep our City’s parks animal-nuisance free; works with non-profit animal shelters; provides consultation to other municipalities concerning animal issues; and assists the Pennsylvania Game Commission in tracking the rabies virus. Animal Care & Control Officers capture stray animals, assist in pet/owner recovery, resolve neighbor disputes over animals, assist the elderly and physically-challenged with animal concerns, advise and teach residents of their responsibility as pet owners, advise non-pet owners of their rights, and assist in the removal of nuisance wildlife. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. The Bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the District Attorney's office with humane investigations. Although Animal Care & Control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly. Many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the City has with a local animal shelter. Due to the wooded mountainous geography of our City, residents share common areas with a host of wildlife (skunks, raccoons, ground hogs, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, etc.) Learn more about how to share space with wildlife by visiting our Living with Wild Life page . The City offers 24 hour service. The Animal Care & Control office hours are Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Please visit our Contact Us page. Operations continue from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. Saturdays and Sundays operations are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m, and on holidays, from 8 am to 4 pm. All \"after hour\" operations are for any emergency that a resident may have. Call the after-hours number at 412-255-2935. Responsible pet owners need to know that along with the obligation to properly feed, shelter, and care for a pet, there are laws (ordinances) to protect the animal, the pet owner, and the community. \"Owner\" includes every person who keeps or shelters and every person who allows an animal to be on their property (land or house) which is occupied by him or her. This means that if you are in possession of an animal, whether you own it or not - you're responsible for its care, behavior, and welfare.

        "content": "Toggle navigation Points Places Parcels Data: Points About Tweet Locations are not exact. (See ’About’ for details.) to Enable Heat Map 311 Requests Police Blotter Arrests Non-Traffic Citations Fire Incidents Code Violations Capital Projects Right of Way Permits Traffic Collisions Collision Time (24-hour clock) 0 24 0 24 0 — 24 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 Basemap OSM Mapnik OSM Mapnik Filter by Area Select Layer: 311 Requests 311 Requests At first glance, Burgh’s Eye View might seem like some­thing from the dreams of our most “neb­by” neigh­bors. For the first time, you can easi­ly see all kinds of data about Pitts­burgh—includ­ing 311 re­quests, build­ing permits, code violat­ions, pub­lic safe­ty in­ci­dents, city assets, and public records on every par­cel in the city. But City data isn’t a log of when and where we put our park­ing chairs. It’s a huge col­lect­ion of in­form­ation about the world a­round us that can help us under­stand what’s happen­ing in our neigh­bor­hoods, and lead us to ideas and decis­ions that can make where we live bet­ter. We think of it as neb­by for the great­er good. So, whether you’re look­ing at in­form­at­ion about side­walks that need re­pair­ing, or map­ping out street­lights that are a lit­tle too dim, re­mem­ber: While data can help us know, its high­est pur­pose is to help us join to­get­her with other re­sid­ents and the City to make change. Ok, so how do I use it? Burgh’s Eye View uses maps to visualize data generated by the City of Pittsburgh and its residents. As you play with it—changing the date range, for example—what you see on the map will change. You can scroll to zoom or use the +/- buttons at the top left, click on pins to see details, and move the map around using a mouse or touch. Currently, three general map types are available: maps of points, places and parcels. Points The points map shows data located at specific points in the city, such as public safety incidents, 311 requests, code violations, capital projects, and city assets. Search You can search for a specific address or block, as well as other keywords in some of the data. But keep in mind that a lot of location information is generalized to the block or neighborhood level in order to protect people's privacy. Some sensitive datasets don't have addresses at all, and so will not react to address searches. Dates Most information on the Points map has a date attached to it. Change the date range to see things from a certain day, week, month, or any period you’re interested in. Data Using these checkboxes, you can turn off datasets to get a clearer view of what you're interested in. Some datasets have specific filters just for them. You can set those filters in the fields below each checkbox. 311 Requests This layer allows you to see 311 requests , which are non-emergency concerns or questions that residents send to the City using the 311 call center, social media , text message, the website , or the myBurgh apps for iOS or Android . As you can imagine, residents have a wide range of concerns and questions. Start typing in the “Request Type” box to select the types of requests you want to see on the map. You can also view requests that are assigned to specific City departments or agencies, and view requests by origin (whether they were submitted as a call, on social media, etc). Click any of the orange icons on the map to learn more about a specific 311 request Public Safety Information These layers allow you to see incidents captured in the 30-day police blotter , the police blotter archive as well as non-identifying information on arrests and non-traffic citations . Use the Hierarchy field to find specific types of crimes. Click on any of the blue, red, or pink icons on the map to learn more about a specific public safety incident. Building Information These layers allow you to see information on violations and city facilities . Select or start typing in the “Violation,” “Inspection Result,” “Next Action,” or “Facility Usage” fields to narrow down or view specific results. Click on any of the blue, green, or gray icons on the map to learn more about a specific permit, violation, or facility. \"Filter by Area\" Are you interested in looking at information for a particular neighborhood, Council district, Police zone, or Public Works division? Select the type of area you want to see—the default is Neighborhood—and then you can set the specific area or areas below that. As with Search, some datasets' locations are generalized and may not react to these filters. Also, if you like videos, check out these how-tos produced by our Cable Channel: Introduction and Overview Use Case: Public Safety Downloading Data Places The Places map allows you to view a wide range of City assets, including bridges and recreation space, steps, pools, historic districts, flood zones, traffic signals, and more. Search You can search for data in a specific neighborhood, as well as other keywords in some of the data. Data Using these checkboxes, you can turn off datasets to get a clearer view of what you're interested in. Some datasets have specific filters just for them. You can set those filters in the fields below each checkbox. Traffic Signals The traffic signals section includes some terms that may be new to our users. “Actuated” means that the timing of a signal is determined by the number of vehicles detected at an intersection. “Actuated ped” means that the pedestrian button must be pushed to activate the signal timing for pedestrians; “fixed per” means that a pedestrian button does not need to be pushed. “Fully actuated” means that the signals are controlled by sensors, cameras, or radar. Parcels The Parcels map allows you to view, at the neighborhood level, delinquent properties, City-owned properties, and properties in a tax abatement program. You can also view information about any specific parcel, including type of owner, property class, sale information, county land value, and potential liens. Some information, including the owner’s name, is not included in order to protect people's privacy. While data on properties that are tax delinquent, in a tax abatement program, or city-owned comes from the City of Pittsburgh, all other data on the Parcels maps comes our partners at Allegheny County. \"Filter by Neighborhood\" Are you interested in looking at information for a particular neighborhood? Select the neighborhood you want to see—the default is the Central Business District. Search You can search for specific parcels in the chosen neighborhood by entering in the parcel's ID. However, the search feature also allows you to search for things like address, owner code, and use code. Individual Parcels Once you’ve selected the neighborhood you’d like to see, or entered the Parcel ID, you can click on any of the parcels to see information about that property. Wait, why are things where they are? Markers or “pins” for each dataset show up on the map differently depending on the source. Public Safety pins are geocoded by the block or intersection of the incident or arrest using Allegheny County's geocoder, every night. Code violations are geocoded at the center of their respective parcel, which is determined by Allegheny County. 311 Requests are first geocoded by the City's 311 request tracking system. To maintain citizens' privacy these requests are then specially obfuscated. This process is handled by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center , and they describe it this way: For some less-sensitive request types, actual coordinates appear in the 311 open data. For more sensitive requests, coordinates representing the approximate location of the complaint are shared to protect the identity of the person making the complaint. The data file indicates whether exact or approximate coordinates have been included. Wow, is there more like this? Whenever possible, Burgh’s Eye View will point you to other resources for the data or information you are viewing. This includes links to the Allegheny County Real Estate Portal , the 311 Request Online Form , and the City Online Facility Rental page. All of these resources are available 24/7, just like Burgh’s Eye View. This page has lots of links to other City data, information and resources, and you can find more at pittsburghpa.gov or by following the city on Twitter and Facebook . And yes there are more projects like this to come! You can write to the team that built this at analytics@pittsburghpa.gov . We'd love to hear your feedback, ideas, and hopes for the future of data in the City of Pittsburgh. (But please note that we may not be able to respond individually.) Burgh’s Eye View is an initiative of the Department of the Innovation & Performance ’s Analytics & Strategy Team. We work under the vision and leadership of Mayor Bill Peduto, who has from day one been committed to being transparent and open with City data."

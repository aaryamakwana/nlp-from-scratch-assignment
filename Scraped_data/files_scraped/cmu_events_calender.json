A group of 13 Jews, however, survived in the basement of a home in the city and saw the end of World War II. This group\u2019s survival testifies to the brutal force of the murder campaigns in and around the ghetto.\nIt also demonstrates the agency Jewish children, youngsters, women and men developed in the face of marginalization, abuse and horrific violence and which enabled them to survive, in hiding or as part of so-called partisan units that gathered in the forests and swamps around Minsk and many other Belarusian cities and towns.\nAnika Walke\u2019s current research looks at the long aftermath of the Nazi genocide in Belarus. In particular, she is interested in how people remember and live with the effects and repercussions of systematic violence. She has recently taught courses on the Holocaust and the history of the Soviet Union and will join the CMU History Department in fall 2025 as the inaugural Askwith Family Professor.\nSponsored by the Department of History, The Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies, and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences."

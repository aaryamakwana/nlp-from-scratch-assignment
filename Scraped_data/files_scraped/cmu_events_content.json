All alumni are eligible for this award, including those who have received prior alumni honors from the university or one of its colleges, schools or departments. Alumni Achievement Award Awarded to an alumnus/a for exceptional accomplishment and leadership in the nominee's professional or vocational field, which brings distinction to themselves and honor to the university. The contribution(s) need not be publicly renowned but should represent important creative effort or accomplishment with significant impact and value. Alumni Service Award Presented to an alumnus/a for volunteer service to the university or any of its alumni organizations. Several dimensions of service are considered, including breadth of service (service in multiple CMU volunteer roles), depth or longevity of service, and impact of volunteer service on the alumni organization and/or the university. Financial contributions are specifically excluded from consideration for this award, although volunteer service soliciting contributions on behalf of the university or service on CMU fundraising committees is applicable. This award does not consider volunteer service to non-CMU organizations. Similarly, Carnegie Mellon employees or those alumni with business relationships to the university are not eligible on the basis of their employment duties or business services.

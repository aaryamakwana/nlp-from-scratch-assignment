It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania , after Philadelphia , and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census . The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River , which combine to form the Ohio River . [ 7 ] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia , the second-largest in Pennsylvania , and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia . Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry . [ 8 ] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest , as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British Empires, Virginians , Whiskey Rebels , and Civil War raiders . [ 9 ] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. [ 10 ] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city. [ 11 ] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Allegheny Health Network , and 68 colleges and universities , including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh . [ 14 ] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense , software engineering , robotics , energy research , and the nuclear navy . [ 15 ] In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Other corporations that have regional headquarters and offices have helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth. [ 16 ] Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges . [ 8 ] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy , Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium , Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens , the National Aviary , and a diverse cultural district . [ 17 ] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers , Pittsburgh Penguins , and Pittsburgh Pirates . Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit . Etymology [ edit ] Main article: Name of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes , in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham . As Forbes was a Scotsman , he probably pronounced the name / ˈ p ɪ t s b ər ə / PITS -bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh ). [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act: [ 20 ] \"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\" [ 21 ] From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations. [ 22 ] [ 18 ] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed. [ 18 ] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921. [ 23 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Pittsburgh For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh . Historical claims Kingdom of France 1690s–1763 Great Britain 1681–1781 United States 1776–present Native Americans [ edit ] The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans . [ 24 ] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan , the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island , in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood. [ 25 ] : 289 18th century [ edit ] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution Fort Pitt Block House , built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh. The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River . [ 26 ] [ better source needed ] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements. [ 27 ] In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers. [ 27 ] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War , the North American front of the Seven Years' War , began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne. [ 28 ] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field . General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt , named after William Pitt the Elder , while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\". [ 29 ] During Pontiac's War , a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run . Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy , based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois . A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\". [ 34 ] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk. [ 37 ] Following the American Revolution , the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country . In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes . Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory . 19th century [ edit ] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857 Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874) Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877 The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition . [ 38 ] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River . [ 39 ] The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising . By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine . By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany . Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom. [ 40 ] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad. [ 41 ] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act , as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada. [ 40 ] The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania , which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company . He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century [ edit ] An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902 [ 42 ] Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906 In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel . By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city , accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk , concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia . [ 43 ] The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936. The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population. [ 44 ] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century. [ 45 ] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers. [ 46 ] During World War II , demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort. [ 29 ] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\" [ 47 ] [ 48 ] was being overshadowed by James Parton 's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\" [ 49 ] Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures. [ 11 ] In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century [ edit ] During the late 2000s recession , Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values. [ 50 ] In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh. [ 51 ] Geography [ edit ] See also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km 2 ), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km 2 ) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km 2 ), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. The city is on the Allegheny Plateau , within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau . [ 52 ] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River . The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh , Carnegie Mellon University , Chatham University , Carnegie Museum and Library , and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential. Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features. [ a ] The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks. [ 53 ] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers. [ 54 ] Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail. Cityscape [ edit ] Areas [ edit ] See also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods , List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh , List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations , and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle, [ 55 ] and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods). [ 56 ] Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. Golden Triangle [ edit ] Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m). [ 57 ] The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River . This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority 's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south. [ 58 ] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown . North Side [ edit ] Further information: North Side (Pittsburgh) Townhouses in the Mexican War Streets neighborhood The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. The area was once known as Allegheny City and operated as its own independent city until 1907, when it was merged with Pittsburgh despite great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium , PNC Park , Kamin Science Center , National Aviary , Andy Warhol Museum , Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh , Randyland , Penn Brewery , Allegheny Observatory , and Allegheny General Hospital . [ 59 ] South Side [ edit ] Further information: South Side (Pittsburgh) East Carson Street in the South Side Flats The South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Starting in the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation , encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years leading up to 2014. [ 60 ] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues. In 1993, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development that included a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers . Construction of the development began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters . [ 61 ] East End [ edit ] Shadyside neighborhood The East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh , Carnegie Mellon University , Carlow University , Chatham University , The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History , Phipps Conservatory , and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall . It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park , Westinghouse Park , Schenley Park , Frick Park , The Frick Pittsburgh , Bakery Square , and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues. [ 62 ] Oakland , heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center . The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs. [ 63 ] Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze , Regent Square , Highland Park , Homewood , Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar , Larimer , East Hills , East Liberty , Polish Hill , Hazelwood , Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights. West End [ edit ] Further information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region The West End includes Mt. Washington , with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott . Ethnicities [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area , a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau . Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission , and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\" [ 66 ] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\", [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a. [ 74 ] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%. [ 75 ] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year, [ 76 ] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year. [ 76 ] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901. [ 76 ] [ b ] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995. [ 76 ] Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018. [ 77 ] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51. [ 78 ] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy. [ 79 ] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).

The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog. [ 83 ] According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an “80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023. [ 86 ] A past 2019 \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three. [ 87 ] In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works , the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey. [ 90 ] The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia. [ 91 ] Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999. [ 92 ] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\" [ 93 ] As of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance. [ 94 ] Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average. [ 95 ] The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. [ 95 ] Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh. [ 95 ] The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities. [ 95 ] This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism. [ 96 ] Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh. [ 97 ] WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education. [ 97 ] In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities. [ 98 ] Water quality [ edit ] The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits. [ 99 ] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959. [ 100 ] Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water. [ 101 ] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers. [ 102 ] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations. [ 103 ] The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority , or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions. [ 104 ] In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement. [ 107 ] In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority. [ 108 ] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). [ 107 ] PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water. [ 109 ] Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels. [ 110 ] In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties. [ 111 ] By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality. [ 111 ] Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014, [ 110 ] from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection. [ 112 ] Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water. [ 112 ] In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water. [ 112 ] Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit. [ 110 ] In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia. [ 111 ] In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water. [ 113 ] Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. [ 113 ] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead. [ 113 ] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system. [ 114 ] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. [ 114 ] Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.

Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010, [ 119 ] compared to 78.7% in 1970. [ 120 ] By the 2020 census , the population slightly declined further to 302,971. [ 118 ] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation, [ 126 ] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census. [ 127 ] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States. [ 128 ] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country. Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. [ 129 ] According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area. [ 129 ] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200. [ 130 ] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell ; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center . [ 131 ] [ 132 ] According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant , and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population.

The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.

[ 140 ] Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are from China , India , Korea and Italy . [ 141 ] Demographic changes [ edit ] Since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment. Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena. [ 13 ] This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961. [ 13 ] The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns. An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950. [ 13 ] Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now. [ 142 ] These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena. [ 13 ] In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes. [ 143 ] Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.” [ 143 ] The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place. [ 142 ] Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification. [ 144 ] Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place. [ 145 ] Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Pittsburgh See also: List of corporations in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh. [ 250 ] Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories “police budget cost per person,” “fines / forefeitures,” “Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),” “Force Used per Arrest,” “Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,” “Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,” “Discrimination Complaints Upheld,” “Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,” “Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,” and “Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.” This is 10 out of 15 categories.

[ 304 ] Expressways and highways [ edit ] Expressways Other Highways Parkway North US 19 PA 88 Parkway East & West Truck US 19 PA 121 Crosstown PA 8 PA 130 Allegheny Valley Expressway PA 50 PA 380 Ohio River Boulevard PA 51 PA 837 PA 60 PA 885 I-279 Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 ( Pennsylvania Turnpike ) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79 , the Pittsburgh International Airport , the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80 . The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena . The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70 , 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway , Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region. Airports [ edit ] Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports Pittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area . Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh. Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh). Intercity passenger rail and bus [ edit ] Main articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center Amtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station , via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City. Megabus , Greyhound Lines , and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia , New York City , and Washington, D.C. [ 305 ] Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station , Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station , Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station. Regional mass transit [ edit ] Main articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit Steel Plaza subway station Pittsburgh Regional Transit , formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States. [ 306 ] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems. [ 307 ] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust, [ 308 ] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares. The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter . These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport , Monroeville , McCandless , and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania . Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library , taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon , Mt. Lebanon , and Beechview , and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook . Freight rail [ edit ] Union Station , built in 1903 Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works , which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse 's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway 's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line , and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard , built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX , the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh. Port [ edit ] The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade. [ 309 ] Notable people [ edit ] Main article: List of people from Pittsburgh Sister cities [ edit ] Pittsburgh's sister cities are: [ 310 ] Bilbao , Spain Da Nang , Vietnam Fernando de la Mora , Paraguay Gaziantep , Turkey Glasgow , Scotland Karmiel , Israel Matanzas , Cuba Misgav , Israel Naucalpan , Mexico Ostrava , Czech Republic Prešov , Slovakia Saarbrücken , Germany Saitama , Japan San Isidro , Nicaragua Sheffield , England [ g ] Skopje , North Macedonia Sofia , Bulgaria Wuhan , China Zagreb , Croatia See also [ edit ] Pennsylvania portal Cities portal Greater Pittsburgh Region List of fiction set in Pittsburgh List of municipalities in Pennsylvania List of people from Pittsburgh Explanatory notes [ edit ] ^ The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights , Bluff , Brighton Heights , Crafton Heights , Duquesne Heights , East Hills , Fineview , Highland Park , Middle Hill , Mount Oliver , Mount Washington , Northview Heights , Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill , Ridgemont , South Side Slopes , Spring Hill-City View , Squirrel Hill , Stanton Heights , Summer Hill , Troy Hill , and Upper Hill . ^ The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980. [ 76 ] ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. ^ Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown , at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

      "Pittsburgh ( PITS-burg) is a city in and the county seat of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania, after Philadelphia, and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River. It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. \n",
      "Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry. It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British Empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders. For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city. However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.\n",
      "Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network, and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy. In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Other corporations that have regional headquarters and offices have helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth. \n",
      "Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges. Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district. The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.\n",

      "== Etymology ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name  PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).\n",
      "Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\n",
      "\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"\n",
      "From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations. After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed. The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.\n",

      "=== Native Americans ===\n",
      "The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans. Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.: 289 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 18th century ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River. European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.\n",
      "In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers. During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne. The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\n",
      "During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\n",
      "During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\". Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.\n",
      "On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township. William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\n",
      "Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 19th century ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.\n",
      "The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n",
      "In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.\n",
      "Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom. The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad. Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\n",
      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 20th century ===\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\n",
      "The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.\n",
      "The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.\n",
      "The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population. Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century. Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\n",
      "During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort. This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\" was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\n",
      "Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\n",
      "In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n",

      "=== 21st century ===\n",
      "During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\n",

      "== Geography ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.\n",
      "The city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau. The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.\n",
      "Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.\n",
      "The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks. Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.\n",
      "Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\n",

      "\n",
      "==== Areas ====\n",
      "\n",
      "The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle, and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods). Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== Golden Triangle =====\n",
      "Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m). The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south. It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== North Side =====\n",
      "\n",
      "The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. The area was once known as Allegheny City and operated as its own independent city until 1907, when it was merged with Pittsburgh despite great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, Kamin Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Penn Brewery, Allegheny Observatory, and Allegheny General Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== South Side =====\n",
      "\n",
      "The South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Starting in the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years leading up to 2014.  East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.\n",
      "In 1993, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development that included a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction of the development began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.\n",

      "===== East End =====\n",
      "\n",
      "The East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues. Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs. Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze, Regent Square, Highland Park, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, East Liberty, Polish Hill, Hazelwood, Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights.\n",

      "Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n",
      "Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\" In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\", recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Climate ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S. The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a. The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.\n",
      "The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year, a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year. Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901. Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.\n",
      "Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018. On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51. There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy. In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).\n",

      "==== Air quality ====\n",
      "The American Lung Association's (ALA) 2023 “State of the Air” report (which included data from 2019 to 2021) showed air quality in Pittsburgh improving. The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog.\n",
      "According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time. Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an “80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023.\n",
      "A past 2019 \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.\n",
      "In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas. The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey. The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.\n",
      "Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999. ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\"\n",
      "As of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.\n",
      "Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average. The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh. The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities. This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.\n",
      "Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh. WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education. In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Water quality ====\n",
      "The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits. This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959. Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water. As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers. Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations. The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions. In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.\n",
      "Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement. In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority. Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).\n",
      "PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water. Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels. In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties. By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality. Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014, from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection. Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.\n",
      "In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water. Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit. In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia. In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water. Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.\n",
      "There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system. Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.\n",

      "=== Demographic changes ===\n",
      "Since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment.\n",
      "Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena. This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961. The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns. An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950. Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now. These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.\n",
      "In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.\n",
      "Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”\n",
      "The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place. Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification. Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.\n",

Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".

It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party, as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party.

There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim. This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic. This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million. About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.\n",

Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.\n",

      "Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.\n",
      "Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh.\n",

       "  'content': '  Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.  1 of 2William C. Wall: View of the Great Fire of PittsburghView of the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, oil on canvas by William C. Wall, 1846; in the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pa. 51 × 81 cm.(more)2 of 2Pittsburgh: steel mill, 1886Bessemer converters in operation at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, 1886.(more)  Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.   After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881.  map of Pittsburgh, c. 1900Map of Pittsburgh (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.(more)  By 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power.'},\n",

       "  'content': '  By the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.

Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).  Carnegie Library of PittsburghCarnegie Library of Pittsburgh in 1901.(more) \\n  Central to the city’s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performs at Heinz Hall, a restored movie theatre.   Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses. The city’s zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two new sports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle: PNC Park is home of the Pirates, the city’s professional baseball team, and Acrisure Stadium houses the Steelers, its professional football team. The Penguins, Pittsburgh’s professional ice hockey team, plays at PPG Paints Arena. Popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on Pittsburgh’s waterways and Kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in West Mifflin.'}]"

However, \\nadmissio n fees to places that provide food or drink, including alcoholic beverages, but \\ndo not otherwise provide entertainment or recreation, are not Exempt  Amusements  if \\nthe primary purpose of the event is to market  or showcase  one or more  commercial \\nproduct s, even if ancillary historical, scientific or educational material also is provided \\nto the patron.   Admission fees to tasting events that offer food or drink, but do not offer \\nentertainment or recreation, are Exempt Amusements if the Producer collect s sales or  \\ndrink taxes from the patron  based on the admission charge or contribution.     \\n \\n4.

(Ord.  38-1991,  eff. 11-25-91).  \\n \\ng. When  the City of Pittsburgh’s  Amusement  Tax is included  in the total collections \\nfrom patrons , the formula  for the Amusement  Tax is: \\n \\nA = Amusement  Tax  15   \\nA = .05 tax rate \\n1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate \\n \\nA = .05 tax rate \\n1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate \\n \\nA = .04762  \\n \\n \\nThe Amusement Tax is deemed included in the Established Price charged the patron if the \\nProducer does not  separately state the Amusement Tax on any ticket or receipt as required \\nby Section 303 , or if no receipt or ticket is issued to the patron.    \\n \\nEXAMPLE  \\nA = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total  \\n1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate \\n \\nA = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total  \\n1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate \\n \\nA = .04762  X $20.00  Total  \\n \\nA = $ .95  \\n \\nEXAMPLE  \\nTotal  admission  charge  is $20.00  x .04762  = $ .95 tax or \\n$19.05  – Admission  Charge  \\n$ .95 tax = 5% of admission  charge  before  taxes  \\n$20.00  – Total  (Admission  Charge  + Amusement  Tax) \\n \\nSECTION  302 – RECORDS  \\n \\nIn general  each  place  of amusement  must  maintain  complete  and accurate  records  of all \\ntransactions,  the total amount  of consideration  received  from all transactions  and the total \\namount  of tax collected  on the basis  of such  considerations.  Records  to be kept must  \\nconsist  of, but are not limited  to a monthly  summary  showing  the starting  and ending  \\nticket  numbers  for each  series,  the number  of tickets  sold at each  representative  price  and \\nthe amount  of tax collected.  \\n \\nWhere  an amusement  is included  in the price  of food and drink  the place  of amusement  \\nshall total the amount  of sales,  on the cash  register,  prior to the amusement.  The place  of \\namusement  shall begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the place  of \\namusement  ends.  If the place  of amusement  does  not do this it will pay on the 24 hour \\nperiod  of the day that the amusement  occurred.  Once  the total sales  have  been  \\ncalculated  from the place  of amusement,  the admission  charge  equals  the amount  paid for \\nfood and drink  times  ten percent.  The imputed  Amusement  Tax equals  the admission  \\ncharge  times  five percent.  \\n  16  The amount paid for food and drink  x 10% = THE ADMISSION  CHARGE  \\n \\nThe admission  charge  x 5% = THE IMPUTED  AMUSEMENT  TAX \\n \\nRecords  to be kept shall include  part of each  serial  numbered  ticket  used  at each  place  of \\namusement  issued  to each  patron  and copies  of all leases  or contracts  or agreements  \\nsupporting  the transactions  for permanent  use of boxes  or seats  in any place  of \\namusement.  \\n \\nSECTION  303 - TICKET  LABELING  \\n \\na.

The sum total of the established  price  and the tax. \\n \\nFAILURE  TO COMPLY  – in the event  that a Producer  fails to comply  with the ticketing  \\nand labeling  provisions  of Section  241.07(a)  the Producer  shall be subject  to the \\nsuspension  and/or  revocation  of his amusement  permit  pursuant  to section  241.03(c)  of \\nthe Pittsburgh Code. (Ord. 34-1994,  eff. 12-30-94).  The failure to comply with the ticketing \\nand labeling provisions will not excuse the Producer  from timely remitt ing the deemed \\ncollected Amusement Tax.  \\n \\nSECTION  304 – AMUSEMENT  TAX QUESTIONS  AND  ANSWERS  \\nQ. – Are admissions  to a movie  theater  not taxed if provided by an  Institution  of Purely  \\nPublic  Charity?  Is a movie theater  considered  a Performing  Art? \\nA. – No.  Admissions to a movie theater are not considered a Performing Art because it is \\nnot a live performance , and nor would they be considered an Exempt Performing Arts \\nProduction .  \\n \\nQ. – Does  a Producer of home  builders’  show s, trade shows,  or similar exhibitions  have  to \\ncollect the Amusement  Tax?  \\nA. – The admission  receipts  from a home  builders’  show  are properly  subject  to the \\nAmusement  Tax. The Amusement  Tax Chapter  241 of the Pittsburgh  Code  extends,  by  17  definition  to trade  shows  and similar  exhibitions.  \\n \\nQ. – Does  a Producer of wine tasting, beer tasting, whisky tasting, food tasting or similar \\nevents have  to collect the Amusement  Tax?  \\nA. – The admission  receipts  from a tasting event are properly  subject  to the Amusement  \\nTax, if the event is primarily intended to showcase a commercial product  or products , even \\nif no live entertainment or recreation is provided.  However, if the Producer does not provide \\nentertainment or recreation, but does collect sales taxes or drin k taxes, based on the \\nadmission charge or contribution, from the patron, then the event is an Exempt Amusement.    \\nA tasting event is not an Exempt Amusement even if historical or educ ational material is \\nprovided to the patron if such historical or educational material is not the primary purpose \\nof the event.  \\n \\nQ. – A bar with entertainment  has a cover  charge  of $10.00  with the Amusement  Tax \\nincluded.  How much  is the Amusement  Tax?  \\nA. - $10.00  cover  charge  X .04762  = $0.48 Amusement  Tax. \\nQ. – A bar with entertainment  has no cover  charge,  is any Amusement  Tax owed?  If so, \\nhow is it calculated?  \\nA. – The Amusement  Tax is owed.  The cover  charge  shall be imputed  per the City Code.  \\nThe amount  paid for admission  to the amusement  shall be ten (10%)  percent  of the \\namount  paid for refreshment,  service  and merchandise.  (The food and drink  for a bar). \\nThe place  of amusement  must  begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the \\nplace  of amusement  ends.  Once  you have  the total sales  from the place  of amusement  \\nyou are ready  to impute  the admission  charge.  \\nThe amount  paid for food and drink  X 10% = the admission  charge.  The admission  charge  \\nX 5% = the imputed  amusement tax.  \\nAn imputed  admission  charge  is implied,  and the tax will be collected.  An implied  charge  \\nis one that the place  of amusement  would  normally  collect.  The admission  charge  is \\ntherefore  imputed  and the tax paid by the place  of amusement.  \\n \\n  18  ARTICLE  IV \\nADMINISTRATION  AND  \\nENFORCEMENT  \\nSECTION  401 – POWERS  AND  DUTIES  OF TREASURER  (DIRECTOR)  \\n \\na. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer  to collect  and receive  the taxes,  fines,  and \\npenalties  imposed  by the City Code,  Title Two,  Article  VII, Chapter  241. It shall also \\nbe the duty of the Treasurer  to keep  a record  showing  the date of such  receipt.  \\n \\nb. The Treasurer  is charged  with the administration  and enforcement  of the provisions  \\nof the City Code,  and is empowered  to prescribe,  adopt,  promulgate  and enforce  \\nrules  and regulations  relating  to any matter  pertaining  to the administration  and \\nenforcement  of the City Code,  including  provisions  for the reexamination  and \\ncorrections  of declarations  and returns,  and of payments  alleged  or found  to be \\nincorrect,  or as to which  an overpayment  is claimed  or found  to have  occurred,  and \\nto prescribe  forms  necessary  for the administration  of the City Code.  \\n \\nc. The Treasurer  is authorized  to issue a ruling  upon  written  request  of a taxpayer  or \\nProducer . \\n \\nSECTION  402 – EXAMINATION  OF BOOKS  AND  RECORDS  OF PRODUCERS  \\n \\na. Agents  designated  by the Treasurer  are hereby  authorized  to examine  the books, \\npapers  and records  of any Producer  or supposed  Producer , in order  to verify  the \\naccuracy  of any declaration  or return,  or if no declaration  or return  was filed,  to \\nascertain  the tax due. Every  Producer  or supposed  Producer , is hereby  directed  and \\nrequired  to give to the Treasurer,  or to any agent  designated  by him/her,  the means,  \\nfacilities  and opportunity  for such  examinations  and investigations,  as are hereby  \\nauthorized.  \\n \\nb. If records  are not available  in the City of Pittsburgh  to support the returns which were  \\nfiled or which  should  have  been  filed,  the Producer  will be required  to make  them  \\navailable  to the Treasurer  either  by producing  them  in a City of Pittsburgh  location  or \\nby paying  for the expenses  incurred  by the Treasurer  in traveling  to the place  where  \\nthe records  are regularly  kept.  \\n \\nc. Any information  gained  by the Treasurer,  by designated  agents,  or by any other  \\nofficial  or agent  of the City of Pittsburgh,  as a result  of any declarations,  returns,  \\ninvestigations,  hearings  or verifications  required  or authorized  by the City Code,  \\nshall be confidential  except  for official  purposes  and shall not be released  except  in \\naccordance  with a proper  judicial  order,  or as otherwise  provided  by law. \\n \\nSECTION  403 – RECORDS  TO BE KEPT  BY THE PRODUCER  \\n \\nProducers  who collect  the Amusement  Tax are required  to keep  such  records  as will enable  \\nthe filing of true and accurate  returns  of the tax and such  records  shall be preserved  for a \\nperiod  of not less than three (3)  years  from the filing date or due date whichever  is later in \\norder  to enable  the Treasurer  or any agent  designated  by him/her  to verify  the correctness   19  of the declarations  or returns  filed. \\n \\nSECTION  404 – AUDITS  \\n \\nIf, as a result  of an examination  conducted by the Treasurer, a return  is found  to be incorrect,  \\nthe Treasurer  is authorized  to assess  and collect  any underpayments  of the Amusement  \\nTax.  If no return  has been  filed and a tax is found  to be due, the tax actually  due may be \\nassessed  and collected  with or without  the formality  of obtaining  a return  from the producer .  \\nDeficiency  assessments  (i.e., where  producer  has filed a return  but is found  to owe \\nadditional  tax) shall include  taxes  for up to three (3) years  prior to the date when  the \\ndeficiency  is assessed.  Where no return  was filed,  there  shall be no limit to the period  of \\nassessment.  \\n \\n  20  ARTICLE  V \\nSUITS  FOR TAX COLLECTIONS, VIOLATIONS,  FINES, INTEREST & \\nPENALTIES  \\nSECTION  501 – REMEDIES  NOT MUTUALLY  EXCLUSIVE  \\n \\nThe remedies  provided  in Section  502 or Section  505 are not mutually  exclusive.   The \\nutilization  by the Treasurer  of one remedy  does  not preclude  utilization  of the other.  \\n \\nMoreover, use of either or both of the remedies  provided in  these  Sections  does  not \\npreclude  the use by the City of Pittsburgh  of any other  legal or administrative procedure  \\nwhich  can bring  about  compliance  by the Producer  with the provisions  of Chapter  241 of \\nthe Pittsburgh  Code  and these regulations.  \\n \\nOnce it has been determined that that a Producer  owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all \\nactions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional \\ninformation, auditing Producer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount \\nof the tax, or obtaining liens on the Producer ’s property, wage attachments, levies, and \\nseizures and sales of the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer \\nmay enter  into a written agreement with the Producer for payment of the tax in installments \\nif the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer \\nmay also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek cri minal \\ncharges in appropriate circumstances.   \\n \\nSECTION  502 – SUITS  FOR  RECOVERY  OF UNPAID  TAXES  \\n \\nThe Treasurer  may sue in the name of the City of  Pittsburgh, in law or in equity, for the  \\nrecovery  of those  taxes  due and unpaid  under  the provisions  of the Amusement  Tax, to \\ncompel  the production  of records  or to enforce  any other  provisions  of the law.  Such suits \\nmay also be brought against Responsible Persons.  \\n \\nSECTION  503 - LIMITATIONS  \\n \\na. The following  periods  of limitations  shall apply  to suits for collection  of taxes.  \\n \\n1. When  a return  has been  filed but no tax paid,  any suit brought  to recover  the tax \\ndue and unpaid  shall be filed within  three  (3) years  after the return  was due or \\nfiled,  whichever  is later.  Where  no return  was filed,  there  shall be no limit to file \\nsuit for the collection of taxes.  \\n \\n2. In the case  of a deficiency  assessment,  suit shall be filed within  three  (3) years  \\nafter the assessment has been made.  \\n \\nb. The limitations  set forth in paragraph  (a) shall not prevent  the institution  of a suit \\nfor the collection  of any tax due or determined  to be due in the following  cases:  \\n \\n1. When  no return  was filed,  there  is no limitation.  \\n \\n2. When  the return  is fraudulent,  there  is no limitation.  \\n  21  3. When  there  is an understatement  of tax liability  of twenty -five (25%)  or more,  and \\nnot due to fraud, suit must  be begun  within  six (6) years.  \\n \\nc. A return  filed before  the due date is deemed  to be filed on the due date.  \\n \\nSECTION  504 – PENALTY  AND  INTEREST  \\n \\na. Producers  must  collect  the tax imposed  herein  and shall be liable  to the City of \\nPittsburgh  for the payment  of the tax. If, however,  any Producer  shall fail to make  \\nany report  and payment  as herein  required  a penalty  at the rate of five (5%)  percent  \\nper month  for each  month  or a fraction  of a whole  month  on the amount  of tax and \\ninterest  of one (1%)  percent  per month  for each  month  or fraction  of a whole  month  \\nduring  the period  in which  the tax remains  unpaid  shall be added  to the tax.  In no \\nevent shall the interest rate assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the \\nMunicipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. 7143, or applicable law.  \\n \\nb. There  is no limit, or cut off point,  for applying penalty and interest  \\n \\nc. Penalty  and Interest  on Deficiency  Assessment.  \\n \\nd. On any additional  tax determined  to be due as a result  of a deficiency  assessment,  \\npenalty  and interest  will be assessed  from the day the tax should  have  been  paid to \\nthe date of payment.   Penalty  and interest  is calculated  as described  above  in the \\napplicable  portion  of Section  504 (a). \\n \\ne. Where  suit is brought  for the recovery  of such  tax, the person  liable  therefore  shall,  \\nin addition,  be liable  for the costs  of collection  and the interest  and penalties  herein  \\nimposed.  Once  due and owing,  penalty  and interest  become  part of the tax and \\nshall be collected  as such.  A person’s  belief  that no tax is due and owing,  or the \\nfailure  of any person  to receive  or obtain  the forms  required  for making  the returns  \\nrequired  under  the City Code  is not a valid defense  to the imposition  of penalties  \\nherein  for violation.   Good  faith shall not be a defense  to the imposition  of penalty.  \\n \\nSECTION  505 – FINES  AND  PENALTIES  FOR  VIOLATION  OF APPLICABLE  \\nPROVISIONS  OF TITLE  TWO,  PITTSBURGH  CODE  \\n \\na. Violations  – No person  shall:  \\n \\n1. Fail, neglect,  or refuse  to make  any declaration  or file a return  required  under  the \\nCity Code.  \\n2. Refuse  to permit  the Treasurer  or his/her  designee  to examine  the books,  records  \\nor accounts  of any business,  taxable  or otherwise,  to determine  liability.  \\n3. Make  any incomplete,  false  or fraudulent  return  or attempt  to do anything  to \\navoid  full disclosure  of the amount  of tax due to avoid  payment  in whole  or in \\npart, of the Amusement Tax.  \\n4. Divulge  information,  which  is confidential  under  Chapter  201.06  of the City Code.  \\n5. Fail to make  any payment  when  it is due.  22  b. In addition  to any other  penalties  or enforcement  proceedings  provided  for by \\nordinance  for the collection  and enforcement  of taxes:  \\n1. Any person  who willfully  fails or refuses  to appear  before  the Treasurer  or his/her  \\nagent  in person  with the employer’s  books,  records  or accounts  for examination  \\nwhen  required  under  the provisions  of Title Two of the City Code  to do so, or who \\nwillfully  refuses  to permit  inspection  of the books,  records  or accounts  of any \\namusement  in the person’s  custody  or control  when  the right to make  such  \\ninspection  by the Treasurer  or his/her  agent  is requested,  shall be guilty  of a \\nmisdemeanor  and shall,  upon  conviction,  be sentenced  to pay a fine of not more  \\nthan five hundred  dollars  ($500)  or to a term of imprisonment of not more than six  \\nmonths, or both.  \\n \\n2. The fines  and terms  of imprisonment,  imposed  under  this Section  shall be in \\naddition  to any other  relief  granted  to the City of Pittsburgh  of a monetary  nature  \\nunder  the provisions  of this Article.  \\n \\n3. Each  and every  day that the violation  continues  shall constitute  a separate  offense  \\nfor which  a fine may be imposed.  \\n \\nSECTION  506 – PERSONAL LIABILITY OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS  \\n \\nBecause the Amusement Tax is collected from Patrons, the Amusement Tax is not the \\nproperty of the Producer but instead is held in trust for the benefit of the City.  Any \\nAmusement Tax collected from patrons or deemed included in the Established Price paid \\nby Patrons shall be considered trust fund taxes  held for the benefit of the City .  Should the \\nProducer fail to timely remit the Amusement Tax due to the City, the Treasurer may assess \\nand collect any unpaid Amusement Tax directly from any Responsible Person  or from the \\nProducer, or both .  A Responsible  Person can show he is not liable for any collected \\nAmusement Tax if he shows the Amusement T ax has been properly refunded to the Patron s \\nwho paid the tax .  If the Producer uses trust fund taxes to pay a lawful obligation of the \\nProducer, the payee of such  funds shall not be considered a Respo nsible Person, unless \\nthe payee acts in bad faith or has direct knowledge of the breach of trust.   \\n \\nIf there are multiple Responsible Persons for a Producer, each Responsible Person shall \\nhave joint and several liabili ty for the unremitted Amusement Tax.  However, in no event \\nmay the Treasurer collect more from the Responsible Persons and the Producer in total \\nthan the Producer owes the City.  \\n \\nOnly the Amusement Tax shall be considered a trust fund asset.  Penalties and  interest \\nassessed against the Provider, as opposed penalties and interest assessed against the \\nResponsible Person directly, shall not be consider trust funds monies.   \\n \\nIn an Article VI action, a  Responsible Person shall not be able to challenge the Amuse ment \\nTax calculation derived from an assessment against the Producer once that assessment \\nagainst the Producer has become final.   \\n  23  ARTICLE VI \\nPRODUCER, \\nTAXPAYER , AND \\nRESPONSIBLE \\nPERSON REMEDIES  \\nSECTION  601 – TREASURER  (DIRECTOR)  HEARINGS  \\nAny taxpayer , Producer, or Responsible Person  aggrieved by  an assessment  by the \\nTreasurer  shall,  within  ninety  (90) days  after the date of notice  of the assessment,  request  \\na Treasurer’s  Hearing  on a form obtained  from the Treasurer  for that purpose.  53 \\nPa.C.S. § 8431. The Treasurer  may on his/her  own initiative  cite a Producer or \\nResponsible Person  for a hearing.  \\n \\na. Any taxpayer , Producer or Responsible Person  who fails to request  a Treasurer’s  \\nHearing  within  a timely  manner,  waives  the right to contest  any element  of the \\nassessment,  and that party’s  failure  to challenge  the Treasurer’s  adjudication  will \\nbe construed  as an admission  by that party  as to the propriety  of the assessment.  \\n \\nb. The written petition for reassessment shall contain at minimum:  \\n \\n1. The petitioner’s name, address, and daytime telephone number.  \\n2. The petitioner’s account and/or social security number.  \\n3. A copy of the assessment notice the party  received from the Finance \\nDepartment.  \\n4. A detailed explanation consisting of the reason or reasons the petitioner \\ndisagrees with the assessment and any documentation necessary to support \\nthe petitioner ’s claims.  \\n5.

The Treasurer will issue its decision within 60 days of the receipt of the petitioner ’s \\ncomplete and accurate petition form . \\n \\n  24  SECTION  602 – APPEALS  \\nAny person  aggrieved  by the decision  of the Treasurer,  following  a hearing,  shall have  \\nthe right to make  an appeal  to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, in \\naccordance with the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights Act. 53 Pa.C.S. § 8434 .  Any appeal  must  \\nbe commenced  within  thirty  (30) days  of the date of the notice  of the Treasurer’s  \\ndecision.  If no such  appeal  is timely  filed,  the aggrieved  party  waives  his/her  right to \\ncontest  any element  of the Treasurer’s  adjudication,  and that party’s  failure  to challenge  \\nthe same  will be construed  as an admission  by that party  as to the propriety  of the \\nTreasurer’s  decision.  No hearing  or appeal  will operate  to suspend  the accrual  of penalty  \\nand interest  from the date the tax was due to the date it is actually  paid.  \\n \\nSECTION  603 – PAYMENT  UNDER  PROTEST  \\nThe Treasurer  will accept  payments  of disputed  tax amounts  under  protest  pending  \\nappeals;  however,  any request  for refund  of such  monies  must  be filed in accordance  \\nwith Section  604. \\n \\nSECTION  604 – REFUNDS  \\na.

For amounts  paid as a result  of a notice  asserting  or informing  a Producer or \\nResponsible Person  of an underpayment, a written request fo r a refund  shall be filed \\nwith the Department  of Finance  within  one (1) year of the date of the payment.  \\nc. Patrons who believe that they are owed a refund  because they overpaid the \\nAmusement Tax , shall first approach the Producer for a refund because the Producer \\nhas the best knowledge of the facts surrounding the amusement.  The Producer shall \\nhave sixty days to review the refund request and grant or deny the refund in writing.  \\nIf a patron  still believes he is owed a refund , after the Producer has issued a written \\nrefusal,  he may file a written request for refund with the Department of Finance.  S uch \\nwritten request shall include the name and address of the patron, the name and \\naddress of the Producer , the date or dates of the amusement, a copy of any ticket or \\nreceipt  issued by the Producer , a short summary of the reasons why the patron \\nbelieves t he tax was overpaid, a copy of the written rejection from the Producer , a \\ncalculation of the overpaid Amusement Tax, and a calculation of the correct \\nAmusement Tax due and a calculation of the amount that should be refunded.

For the required terms \\nof any installment plan See, Second Class City Trea surer’s Sale and Collection Act, 53 P.S. \\n§ 27207 and Local Taxpayer Bill of Rights, 53 Pa.C.S. § 8436.  If the Producer or \\nResponsible Person fails to abide by the terms of the installment payment plan, the \\nTreasurer may demand immediate payment of tax, pe nalty , and interest.  \\n \\n \\n  26  ARTICLE  VII: \\nSAVINGS  AND SEVERABILITY AND DISCLOSURES  \\n \\nSECTION 701 – SAVINGS  CLAUSE  AND  SEVERABILITY . \\nIf a final decision  of a court  of competent  jurisdiction  holds  any provision  of these  \\nregulations,  or the application  of any provision  to any circumstances,  to be illegal  or \\nunconstitutional,  the other  provisions  in these  regulations,  or the application  of such  \\nprovision  to other circumstances,  shall remain in full force  and effect.  \\n \\nThe intent  of the Treasurer  is that the provisions  of these  regulations  shall be severable  \\nand that they would  have  been  adopted  if any such  illegal  or unconstitutional  provisions  \\nhad not been  included herein.  \\n \\nSECTION  702 – DISCLOSURE STATEMENT  \\nA copy  of the Taxpayer  Bill of Rights  can be requested  in writing  at the address  below  \\nor downloaded  at   \\nhttp://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/finance/10_taxpayers_bill_of_rights.pdf  \\n \\nTREASURER,  CITY  OF PITTSBURGH  AUDIT  SECTION  \\n414 GRANT  ST RM 206 \\nPITTSBURGH  PA 15219 -2476  \\n \\n \\n \\n '},\n",

For persons who perform services within and \\nwithout the City, Payroll Expense shall be apportioned in accordance with Section 102 of these \\nregulations.  \\nCHARITY – a charitable organization that qualifies for tax exempt ion pursuant to the act of \\nNovember 26, 1997 (P.L. 508, No 55), known as the “Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act” , \\n10 P.S. § 371, that provides the evidence required by 10 P.S. § 376(a).  \\nCITY – the area within the city limits of the City of Pittsbur gh. \\nCOMPENSATION – salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, net earnings and incentive \\npayments, whether based on profit or otherwise, fees, tips and any other form of remuneration \\nearned for services rendered, whether paid directly or through an agent, and whether in cash \\nor in property or the right to receive property , excluding any Passive Income  received by \\nPartners or Self -employed persons.    \\nThe Compensation of a Partner or Self -employed person is that person’s Taxable Distributions \\nfrom each separate B usiness carried on within the City.  \\n  \\nDISTRIBUTIONS – drawing account; the owner’s account for recording any withdrawals.  \\n  -4-  DRAWING ACCOUNT – a temporary capital account, set up in the name of a Partner  or Self -\\nemployed  person  from which the individual can withdraw money or other assets in anticipation \\nof profit  of the business.  \\nEMPLOYEE – any individual in the service of an Employer, under an appointment or contract \\nof hire or apprenticeship, express or implied, oral or writte n, whether lawfully or unlawfully \\nemployed.    \\nIndividuals who may be classified as an independent contractor under the tax reporting rules \\nassociated with IRS Form 1099 -MISC , can be re -classified as Employees for purposes of this \\ntax.  I rrespective of the common law tests for determining the existence of an independent \\ncontractor relationship, an individual performing work or service for Compensation shall be \\ndeemed to be an Employee of the person for whom the work or service is performed unless: \\n(1) such i ndividual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the \\nperformance of such work or service, under his/her appointment of contract of hire or \\napprenticeship; (2) such work or service is outside the usual course of the business of  the \\nperson for which such service is performed; or, (3) such individual is customarily engaged in \\nan independently established trade, occupation, business or profession.   A Partner or Self -\\nemployed person is not an Employee.  \\n \\nEMPLOYER – any person conduct ing Business within the City .  An Exempt Employer is not \\nan Employer under these regulations.   A Partnership is an Employer a s to its Employees and \\nas to any of its Partners providing service in the City.  A Partner, conducting one or more \\nbusiness es within the City through a Partnership , where the Partnership  does not file a Payroll \\nTax return with the City, is an Employer.   Any Self -Employed Person conducting one or more \\nBusiness within the City is an Employer.  \\n \\nAny person who is classified as an em ployer under the Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax \\nstatute is an Employer under these regulations. 72 P.S. § 7301 (h).  The term Employer \\nincludes any person that makes an election under 26 U.S.C. § 3504 to act as a payroll agent , \\nor any person who  both with holds and  remits the City local earned income tax, 53 P.S. § \\n6924.501 , or the City local services tax, 53 P.S. § 6924.301.1(9) (v), on behalf of another.   53 \\nP.S. § 6924.303(j).   To decide issues involving joint employers, the City will look to the \\nguidance  provided under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2 ( 85 FR 2820 , \\neffective March 16, 2020 ). \\n \\nFor example, a payroll reporting company that is not a common law employer of the workers \\nof another unless it is: (a) an employer of those workers under 72 P.S. § 7301(h) or (b) the \\njoint employer of th ose workers.  \\n \\nEXEMPT EMPLOYER  – any person that is a Governmental Entity .  A contractor or consultant , \\nclassified as a Partner , a Self -employed person,  or a person receiving Form 1099 -MISC,  \\nproviding services to an Exempt Employer is not itself exempt  merely because he or she \\nderives service revenue from a Governmental Entity . \\n \\nGUARANTEED PAYMENTS  – payments to Partners by the Partnership for services that are \\ndetermined without regard to th e net income of the Partnership.  For example, health insurance \\npremiums paid by the Partnership on behalf of any Partner are Guaranteed Payments because \\nthey are determined without regard to the net income of the Partnership.  \\n  -5-  GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY  – any ag ency, authority, department, or instrumentality of the \\nfederal government or of another State, and any unit of government listed under 1 01 Pa. Code \\n§ 23.221.  \\n \\nINTERNAL REVENUE CODE – the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public Law 99 - 514), as \\namended , 26 U.S.C. § 1, and following, as it was in effect on January 1, 20 20.  Any citation to \\nregulations issued under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 C.F.R. § 1, and following, \\nrefers to the regulations in effect on January 1, 20 20. \\n \\nNET DISTRIBUTION – the am ount of a Partner’s or Self -employed person’s draws from net \\nincome from one or more Business es that have activities in the City shall be reported for the \\nPayroll Expense Tax.   For purposes of this regulation,  TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS  are limited \\nby the sum of draws or net income for that Partner  or Self -employed person , whichever is less. \\nIf the Partner’s or Self -Employed person’s Net Distribution exceeds that individual ’s share of \\nnet profit s from a particular Business , the excess draw is a return of capita l. A return of capital \\nis not taxable because this is a liquidation of a Partner’s or Self-employed person’s assets by \\nthe owner .  A Partner’s Taxable Distribution s shall include a partner’s share of Guaranteed \\nPayments from the Partnership.   Taxable Distr ibutions shall be determined using the same tax \\naccounting method used to report taxable income for Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax \\npurposes, Tax Reform Code of 1971.   Taxable Distributions from a Business are presumed to \\nbe derived from the current year’ s net income of that Business.  \\n \\nPARTNER  – an individual owner or member in a Partnership.   A Partner will owe tax based \\non Taxable Distributions.  A Partner is not taxed on his or her Passive Income.  \\n \\nPARTNERSHIP – an unincorporated entity, joint venture, business trust, general partnership, \\nlimited partnership, limited liability company, syndicate, or any other unincorporated \\nassociation , with two or more owners that is taxed for Pennsylvania state income purposes as \\na pass -through entity.   Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7401 (definition of a “Corporation”).  \\nAn unincorporated entity , with one owner,  that is treated under the federal “check -the-box” as \\na disregarded entity is not a Partnership.  26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on \\nJanuary 1, 2 020).  See, Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7307.21.   An unincorporated entity, \\nwith one or more owners, that has made the federal “check -the-box” election to be taxed as a \\n“corporation” is not a Partnership but it may be an Employer.  \\n \\nPASSIVE INCOME  – Items of i ncome earned by a Partner or Self -employed person from \\ninterest  (not derived from working capital investments) , dividends, capital  gains  (except for an \\nindividual who is considered a trader and not an investor) , ground rents, royalties associated \\nwith the development of natural resources  through a non -operating interest , retirement income \\nearned after retirement, and real estate rental income where substantial services are not \\nprovided to tenants , is non-taxable Passive Income.  In determining whet her any portion of net \\nprofits from a Business may constitute Compensation or non -taxable Passive Income, the \\nTreasurer will follow the guidance issued under Tax Refo rm Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7303 (a), \\nand the PA Personal Income Tax Return Guide, except wh ere such guidance is inconsistent \\nwith the purposes of the Payroll Tax .  Income earned by a Partner  or by a Self -employed \\nperson , is not Passive Income if the business provides professional services (e.g. law, \\naccounting, architectural, professional engine ering, actuarial, or medical services) or personal \\nservices to customers, unless the Partner or Self -Employed person is retired , based on age or \\nyears of service,  and does not provide services to the business .  Guaranteed Payments made \\nto a Partner are not  Passive Income.   Payments made to a retiring Partner under Section 736 \\nof the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 736, are Passive Income.   The Passive Income  -6-  exclusion only applies to Partners and Self -employed persons, but not to Employees whose \\nCompensa tion is reported to the taxing authorities on a Form W -2 or Form 1099 -MISC.  \\n \\nPAYROLL EXPENSE – the total Compensation paid, including salaries, wages, net \\ndistributions, commissions, bonuses, stock options and other compensation to all individuals \\nwho duri ng any tax year, perform work or render services in whole or in part in the City of \\nPittsburgh. Employee contributions and deductions resulting from an employee election, \\nwhether deferred or otherwise, to qualified cash or deferred arrangements, such as an Internal \\nRevenue Code Section 401( k) retirement plan or Internal Revenue Code Section 125  \\n“cafeteria plan” , do not reduce total Compensation . Compensation meeting the definition of \\nearned income would be part of the Payroll Expense Tax  associated with a  particular \\nEmployee  who is not a Partner or a Self -employed person .  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § \\n6924.501 (“Earned Income”).  The Payroll Tax is on gross payroll  of the Employer .  The \\nEmployers’ portions of federal and state payroll taxes, health insu rance  premiums , retirement \\nplan contributions , etc., are not  part of taxable  gross payroll.    \\n \\nThe Payroll Expense of a Partner or Self -employed person is the cumulative annual  Taxable \\nDistributions associated with each separate Business  carried on w ithin the Ci ty rather than \\n“Earned Income” as defined in 53 P.S. § 6924.501.  \\n \\nPERSON – a corporation, Partnership, Partner, Self-employed individual, business trust, \\nassociation, unincorporated entity, estate, trust, foundation or natural person. Whenever used \\nin any provision prescribing a fine or penalty the word “person” as applied to Partnerships, \\nshall mean  the Partners thereof, and as applied to corporations and unincorporated \\nassociations, shall mean the officers thereof.   A Governmental Entity  is not a Pe rson.  \\n \\nSELF -EMPLOYED  – an individual  who earns  Compensation from one or more separate \\nBusiness es carried on within the City , other than as an Employee or as a Partner.  The single \\nmember owner of a n unincorporated entity that is treated as disregarded entity under the \\nfederal “check -the-box” regulations, 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on January 1, \\n2020), is treated as Self -Employed and not as a Partner.  The Compensation of a Self-\\nemploy ed individual shall be that person’s Taxable Distributions from each separate business \\nreported on Schedules C, E, or F of the Pennsylvania individual income tax Form PA -40, as \\nwell as any other non-employee Compensation , which is not otherwise reported on  Schedules \\nC, E, or F.  Passive Income  of a Self -employed person is not subject to the Payroll Tax .  If the \\nSelf-Employed person does not keep records of Taxable Distrib utions, the entire net income \\nof each separate Business  is presumed to be a Taxable Dis tribution.  Any individual who is \\nclassified as an Employee, because of the control exercised by the Employer, is not Self -\\nEmployed as to any Compensation associated with that particular Business.  \\n \\nTAX YEAR – a twelve -month period from January 1 to December 31.  \\n \\nTAXPAYER – a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity required \\nhereunder to file a return of payroll expense, or to pay a tax thereon.  An Employer , Partner,  or \\nSelf Employed person are a Taxpayer.   An Exempt Employer is not a Taxpayer.  \\n \\nTEMPORARY SEASONAL OR ITINERANT BUSINESS – shall mean an Employer whose \\npresence in the City is of a duration of one hundred twenty (120) days or less.  \\n \\nTREASURER – references to the Treasurer in these regulations refer to the Director and /or \\nthe Department of Finance. The Director holds principal responsibility for tax administration in \\nthe City of Pittsburgh. The Deputy Director of Finance serves as City Treasurer.   -7-   \\nSECTION 102 – WHO MUST FILE A RETURN  \\n \\na. The City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258, imposes a Payroll Tax on all persons \\nthat engage, hire, employ or contract with one or more individuals, as employees, to \\nperform work or render services within the City of Pittsburgh. The Payroll Tax is \\ncomputed on the employer’s payroll  expense .  The Payroll Tax on Partners and Self -\\nEmployed is computed based on Taxable Distributions  from any Business es. \\nb. One hundred percent of the payroll expense is attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for \\nEmployers whose employees perform work or render services exclusively in the City of \\nPittsburgh.  \\nc. One hundred percent of a Partner’s  or Self -employed person’s Taxable Distributions \\nare attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for person(s) who have net income from sales \\nor services rendered exclusive ly in the City of Pittsburgh.  \\nd. For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and \\npartly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense \\nattributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the perce ntage of the total number of \\nworking hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of \\nworking hours employed within and outside of the City of Pittsburgh for each individual \\nemployee.   Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303( a). \\ne. Employers who have payroll expense consisting of work done within and outside of the \\nboundaries of the City of Pittsburgh , but who do not regularly maintain records showing \\nhours worked so as to be able to use the apportionment method under subsection (d) \\nof this regulation,  may use a representative test period or conduct a survey based on \\nfactual data to arrive at a formula with which to calculate the percentage of payroll \\nexpense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh. Any formula so established will be subject \\nto review and correction by the City of Pittsburgh. A thorough description explaining the \\nformula shall be attached to the first return each year. The data supporting the formula \\nshall be maintained for at least three (3) years as a part of offi ce records for audit and \\nreview purposes.  \\nf. Partners and Self -Employed individuals who have Taxable Distributions generated from \\nintrastate sales or services partly within the City of Pittsburgh or partly outside the City \\nof Pittsburgh shall report on the  Taxable Distributions  associated with sales or services \\nrendered within the City of Pittsburgh. Where it is impractical to determine the exact \\nTaxable Distributions , an apportionment formula may be used. Any formula so \\nestablished will be subject to review a nd correction by the City of Pittsburgh Finance \\nDepartment. The data supporting the formula must be maintained as a part of office \\nrecords for audit and review purposes. A thorough description explaining the formula \\nshall be attached to the first return ea ch year. The data supporting the formula shall be \\nmaintained for at least three  (3) years as a part of office records for audit and review \\npurposes.  \\ng. Partners and Self -employed individuals who have Compensation from sources within \\nand without Pennsylvania , may apportion their Compensation to the City using the \\nformula used reporting personal income tax on Form PA -40, 61 Pa. Code § 109.5, by \\nsubstituting the  word  “City” for the “Commonwealth”  where necessary.   In making that \\ncalculation, a ll intrastate sale s and services within Pennsylvania are deemed allocated \\nto the City if the Partner ’s or Self -employed individual ’s sole office in Pennsylvania is  -8-  located in the City.  \\nh. An employer which conducts business in the City of Pittsburgh on a temporary, seasonal \\nor itinerant basis shall file a return and pay the tax within ten (10) days of the completion \\nof the temporary, seasonal, or itinerant business.  \\n \\n \\nARTICLE II  \\nIMPOSITION OF TAX  \\nSECTION 201 – LEVY AND RATE  \\nThe tax levied pursuant to the City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258 is know n as the \\nPayroll Tax. The rate of tax is fifty-five hundredths of a percent (.55% or .0055) of Payroll \\nExpense generated as a result of an employer conducting business within the City of \\nPittsburgh .  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(a) ; Local Tax Enabling Act. 53 P.S. § \\n6924.311(12) . \\nSECTION 202 – COMPUTATION OF TAX  \\na. The Payroll Tax is a tax that is levied on Employers . This tax is separate and distinct \\nfrom the earned income tax withheld from employees. Under no cir cumstance should \\nthe Payroll Tax be deducted from the employees’ compensation or benefits .  Local Tax \\nEnabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(f).  \\nb. The payroll amount apportioned to the City shall be determined as set forth in Section \\n102 of the Regulations.  \\nc. Tax Base – The tax shall be paid quarterly and the tax for each quarter shall be \\ncomputed on the Payroll  Expense of the current quarter attributable to the City of \\nPittsburgh.   The Tax Base for Partners and Self -Employed individuals is Taxable \\nDistribution s associated with each separate Business within the City.  \\nd. An employer which conducts Business in the City of Pittsburgh on a temporary, seasonal \\nor itinerant basis shall calculate the tax on the total compensation earned while in the \\nCity of Pittsburgh.  \\ne. Discontinuing Business – Every person who ceases to carry on a Business during any \\ntax quarter after having paid the Payroll Tax for the entire quarter shall, upon making \\nproper application on a form obtained from the Treasurer, be entitled to receive a \\nprorated refund of the tax paid based upon the period of time he was not in Business \\nduring the tax quarter. In the event that a person who discontinues Business during any \\ntax quarter does so before payment of the tax becomes due for such tax quarter, said \\nperson may apportion the tax and pay an amount to be computed by multiplying the \\nPayroll Expense for the preceding tax quarter by a fraction whose numerator shall be \\nthe number of days such person was in Business during the current tax quarter and \\nwhose deno minator shall be the total number of days in the current quarter. The final \\nreturn shall be due ten (10) days after the discontinuation of Business.   Self-employed \\nindividuals and Partners are considered to have discontinued their Business only if all \\nsepa rate Businesses of the individual are discontinued.  \\nf. A charitable organization, as defined above, shall calculate the tax that would otherwise \\nbe attributable to the City of Pittsburgh and file a return, but only shall pay the tax on  -9-  that portion of its Payroll Expense attributable to business activity for which a tax may \\nbe imposed pursuant to Section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. § 511.  \\nThat section imposes a federal tax on unrelated business taxable income of a charity \\nthat is exempt from  federal tax under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.  26 \\nU.S.C. § 501(c).  If the charity has purchased or is operating branches, affiliates, \\nsubsidiaries or other business entities that do not independently meet the standards of \\nthe “Institutio ns of Purely Public Charity Act”, the tax shall be paid on the payroll \\nattributable to such for -profit branches, affiliates or subsidiaries, whether or not the \\nemployees are leased or placed under the auspices of the charity’s umbrella or parent \\norganizati on.  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(a.1).   \\ng. By reason of the explicit language in the Local Tax Enabling Act , 53 P.S. § \\n6924.303(a.1), Institutions of Purely Public Charity are n ot exempt from the Payroll Tax.   \\nHowever, Institutions of Purely Public Charity are exempt from Payroll Tax associated \\nwith activities that are related to the charit able purposes for which the Institution was \\nformed.  For purposes of determining whether an activity is related to the cha ritable \\npurposes for which the Institution was formed or unrelated under Section 511 of the \\nInternal Revenue  Code, 26 U.S.C. § 511, the Treasurer will follow federal law in effect \\non January 1, 20 20. \\nh. Any person, other than an Exempt Employer, that believes  that it is exempt from paying \\nthe Payroll Tax, because of a tax  exemption granted under federal, state , or local law \\nshall file its  return , caption the return “ EXEMPT ,” and provid e a short citation to the legal \\nbasis for its exemption.    \\n \\n   -10-  ARTICLE III  \\nEMPLOYER’S RESPONSIBILITY  \\nSECTION 301 – PAYROLL TAX LEVIED ON EMPLOYERS  \\na. Every Employer not registered with the City of Pittsburgh shall, within fifteen ( 15) days, \\nregister with the Treasurer the Employer’s name, address and such other information \\nas the Treasurer may require.  The first return for a new business is calculated on the \\nPayroll  Expense for the portion of the quarter it was in  business.  \\nb. The Payroll Tax is a tax that is levied on Employers.  Under  no circumstance  may the \\nPayroll Tax be deducted from the Employees’ wages.  \\nc. It may be necessary to include Form 1099’s issued to individuals in the  Employer’s \\ncalculations of the Payroll Tax.  See “Employee”  definition.  \\nd. It shall be the Employer’s responsib ility, upon request from the City of Pittsburgh, to \\nprovide a list of sub -contractors which includes their name, address, Federal Employer \\nIdentification Number ( EIN), contact person and their phone number.  \\nHistorical Note  - For the Years 2005 -2015 the Payroll Tax for the First Quarter was \\ndue February 28 based on Payroll Expense In October, November and December of \\nthe prior calendar year.  \\nEFFECTIVE FOR 2016 AND THEREAFTER, THE PAYROLL TAX FOR THE FIRST \\nQUARTER IS DUE ON MAY 31 BASED ON PAYROLL EXPENSE IN JANUARY, \\nFEBRUARY, AND MARCH OF THAT YEAR.  \\ne.

Intrastate \\nreceipts from services which are the result of business activities carried on through a \\nbranch office located outs ide Pittsburgh, are taxable if such services are performed in \\nPittsburgh  if the service is offered from the City . \\n(c) Persons engaging in any Institutional or non -profit service be it\\nprofessional, commercial , or personal services, are subject to the  tax. If a  person \\nengaging in any Institutional or non -profit service only maintains a place of business in \\nthe City of Pittsburgh, the entire receipts from intrastate activity  in the Commonwealth  \\nfrom personal services must be included in the measure of the tax, wh ether or not the \\nservices are performed in Pittsburgh. Receipts will be deemed attributable to Pittsburgh, \\nif they result from the efforts of employees who work in,  or from or are attached to \\ntaxpayer\\'s Pittsburgh place of business.   If any taxpayer is subject to Privilege tax in two \\nor more jurisdictions in Pennsylvania, he may request a ruling from the Treasurer  to \\naddress the issue of potential double taxation .  \\n(d) Receipts associated with interstate commerce shall be apportioned to\\nthe City by multiplying total receipts earned everywhere times the City Apportionment \\npercentage.  The City Apportionment percentage  is the sum of the following three \\napportionment factors:  Payroll  Percentage factor , Property  Percentage factor , and \\nSales Percentage  factor , divided by three . If one of the percentage factors is zero, the \\ndenominator shall be two.  If two of the percentage factors are zero, the dominator shall \\nbe one.   In no event can a percentage factor be less than zero.  \\n(1) The Payroll Percentage factor  shall be payroll reported by the\\ntaxpayer subject to City local earned income tax divided by total payroll reported on \\nFederal Form 940.  If the taxpayer only has one office in the Commonwealth and that \\noffice is in the City, the numerator  of the Payroll percentage factor shall be total payroll \\nreported to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.  \\n(2) The Property Percentage factor  shall be the sum of tangible\\nproperty located in the Cit y divided by the sum of tangible property located everywhere  \\nin the United States, determined as of December 31 .  Property shall be recorded at its \\noriginal cost before any depreciation , amortization, or cost depletion .  Leased property  -14-shall be recorded as an item of tangible property at eight  (8) times annual rent  for the \\nleased property .

If additional guidance is required with regard to the definition of Sales, \\nthe taxpayer shall follow the practice of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue \\nunder the Corporate Net Income Tax provisions of the Tax Reform Act, 72 P.S. § 7401, \\nso long as such pr actice is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Privilege Tax.  \\n(4) A taxpayer is engaged in interstate commerce if it is subject to tax\\nin another jurisdiction , outside the Commonwealth,  on its net income or on its gross \\nreceipts.   A taxpayer can show it is subject to tax in another jurisdiction by providing \\ncopies of tax returns  filed with taxing jurisdictions outside the Commonwealth.   If \\nintrastate receipts are co -mingled with interstate activity, all receipts shall be \\nconsidered interstate receipts.  \\n(5) If the application of the City apportionment percentage  results in\\nthe same gross receipts of the Taxpayer being taxable , for gross receipts or privilege \\ntax purposes,  by two or more jurisdictions  in the United States , the Taxpayer may \\napproach the Treasurer  for a ruling  to avoid this double taxation, such as receiving a \\ncredit for gross receipts or privilege taxes paid  elsewhere , or by a modification of the \\nCity apportionment percentage.   No credit will be granted by the City for net income \\ntaxes , excise taxes,  or transaction taxes  paid to another jurisdiction.   -15-ARTICLE V  \\nSUITS FOR COLLECTION, PENALTIES, ETC.  \\nSection  501. — Suits for Recovery of Unpaid T axes.  \\n(a) The following periods of limitations shall apply to suits for collection of\\ntaxes.  \\n(1) When a return has been filed but no tax paid, any suit brought to\\nrecover the tax due and unpaid shall be filed within three (3) years after the return was \\ndue or filed, whichever is later. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to file \\nsuit for the  collection of taxes.  \\n(2) In the case of a deficiency assessment, suit shall be filed within\\nthree (3) years after the assessment has been made.  \\n(b) The limitations set forth in paragraph (a) shall not prevent the institution\\nof a suit for the collection of any ta x due or determined to be due in the following cases:  \\n(1) When no return was filed, there is no limitation.\\n(2) When the return is fraudulent, there is no limitation.\\n(3) When there is an understatement of tax liability of twenty -five\\n(25%) or more, and not due to fra ud, suit must be begun within six (6) years.  \\n(4) A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the due\\ndate.  \\nSection 502 . — Penalty and Interest for N on-payment.  \\n(a) If, however, any Taxpayer shall fail to make any report and payment as\\nherein required a penalty at the rate of one-half  of one percent (0.5%) per month for \\neach month or a fraction of a whole month on the amount of tax and interest of one \\n(1%) percent per month for each month or fraction of a whole month during the period \\nin which the tax remains unpaid shall be added to the tax.  In no event shall the \\ninterest rate assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the Municipal Claims and \\nTax Liens Act, 53 P.S. §7143, or applicable law. \\n(b) There is no limit or cut off point, for applying penalty and interest.\\n(c) On any additional tax determined to be due as a result of a deficiency\\nassessment, penalty and interest will be assessed from the day the tax should have \\nbeen paid to t he date of payment.  Penalty and interest is calculated as described \\nabove.  \\n(d) Where suit is brought for the recovery of such tax, the person liable\\ntherefore shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection and the interest and \\npenalties herein impo sed. Once due and owing, penalty and interest become part of \\nthe tax and shall be collected as such. A person’s belief that no tax is due and owing, \\nor the failure of any person to receive or obtain the forms required for making the \\nreturns required under the City Code is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties \\nherein for violation.  Good faith shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty.   -16-Section  503. – Fines and Penalties for Violation of Act.  \\n(a) Whoever willfully makes any false or untrue  statement on the return shall,\\nupon summary conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than five \\nhundred dollars ($500.00) or to undergo imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) \\ndays.  \\n(b) Whoever willfully fails or refuses to appear before the Treasurer, in\\nperson with his books, records or accounts for  examination when required under the \\nprovisions of the Institution and Service Privilege Tax Ordinance, to do so, or who \\nwillfully refuses to permit inspection of the books, records or accounts of any services \\nin custody or control,  when the right to make such inspection by the Treasurer is \\nrequested,  shall upon summary conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not \\nmore than Five Hundred Dollars  ($500.00), or to undergo imprisonm ent for not more \\nthan thirty (30 ) days.  \\n(c) Whoever willfully fails or refuses to file a return required by the  Instit ution\\nand Service Privilege Tax Ordinance , shall, upon summary conviction thereof, be \\nsentenced to pay a fine of not more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), or undergo \\nimprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days . \\nSection 504 . – Remedies Not Mutually Exclusive  \\nThe remedies provided in this Article are not mutually exclusive.  The utilization by the \\nTreasurer of one remedy does n ot preclude utilization of the other.  \\nMoreover, use of either or both of the remedies provided in these Sections does not \\npreclude the use by the City of Pittsburgh of any other legal or administrative procedure \\nwhich can bring about compliance by the Taxp ayer with the provisions of Chapter 241 \\nof the Pittsburgh Code and these regulations.  \\nOnce it has been determined that that a Taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take \\nall actions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining  \\nadditional information, auditing Taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the \\ndisputed amount of the tax, or obtaining liens on the Taxpayer’s property, wage \\nattachments, levies, and seizures and sales of the Taxpayer’s property in appropriate \\ncircumstances. The Treasurer may enter into a written agreement with the Taxpayer for \\npayment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will \\nfacilitate collection.

The \\npro rata share shall be determined by dividing the rate of the Local Services Tax levied for the \\ncalendar year by  the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar \\nyear. Example:  $52 /26 pay periods equal $2 per pay.  Employers are required to remit the  \\nLocal Services Tax thirty days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

How is the LST deducted from the employee’s pay and remitted to the City? Example, \\nemployees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more.  What is  \\nthe employer’s  responsibility?  \\nANSWER:  The employer is required to withhold the pro -rata share of the tax by dividing  \\n$52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. \\nThe $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per \\nmonth for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculat ing the pro -rata share, employers are \\nrequired to round down to the nearest one -hundredth of a dollar.  \\nThe employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The  \\ntax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The  LST forms can be \\ndownloaded  at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  \\n2. At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City  \\nfor the entire  calendar  year.  Should  the employer  withhold  the LST?  \\nANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that \\nhe will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to  \\nwithhold the LST.  The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available  \\nfor employees to  complete.  \\nThe exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/fin ance  \\n3. A new hire files an exemption certificate with his employer. The employer and his \\nemployee realize with 13 weeks left in the year that he will earn $12,000 because he is \\nworking more hours than anticipated. He is paid weekly. Is his employer responsib le for \\nwithholding the LST now?  \\nANSWER: Yes. After the employer realizes that the employee will  earn  $12,000  or \\nmore, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch -up then  \\n$1.00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of  $52. \\n4. Employee has two part -time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year \\nand another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year. Does this person need to  \\npay the  LST?  \\nANSWER: No.  The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate w ith both employers  \\nand have  no LST deducted.  The Taxpayer  is not subject  to the LST since  he did not earn \\n$12,000 in any single municipality. If the tax was withheld the employee could file a  \\nrefund claim with each municipality after January 31 of the following year. The refund \\nrequest form can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  - the form is \\nlisted  as LST REFUND  FORM.  \\n5. An individual works January thru June in the City and July thru December in Municipality \\n“A”. He earns $10,000 a month at both jobs and is paid once a week. What is his liability \\nto Pittsburgh?  \\nANSWER: His employer in the City should withhold $1 a week for 26 pay periods and \\nremit $26 along with his other employees’ deductions to the City. Municipality “A” would \\nbe entitled to the LST for the 2nd half of the year. The emp loyee should provide proof of \\nLST paid for the first half of the year to Municipality “A”.   -7-  6. An individual works July thru December in the City. He did not work January thru June, \\nanywhere. He earns $10,000 a month. Does he owe the $52 LST to t he City?  \\nANSWER: Yes. His employer knows that this employee is over  the  $12,000  low  \\nincome exemption level. No exemption certificate has been filed. The $52 may be \\nprorated for the rest of the year; however the employer should withhold $52 because that  \\nis what  the employee  owes.  \\nSECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the \\nprior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current \\npayroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid \\nonce a week, h e would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be \\ndeducted from one paycheck.  \\n7. An employee has 2 jobs and both are part time. Both started at the beginning of January. \\nJob #1 is in the City and pays the employee $1,000 a month. Job #2 is in Municipality “A” \\nand paid the taxpayer $500. Where should the tax be  paid?  \\nANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the \\nmost should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City. The LST \\nshoul d be paid to the City. The employee should file an exemption certificate with \\nMunicipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City.  \\n8. On January 1, an employee worked for an employer in Municipality “A” and paid $10. In \\nJune the emplo yee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job.   \\nIs the employer  required  to withhold  the LST from the employee?  \\nANSWER: Yes. The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid) \\nif the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”. Then the \\nemployer must pro -rate the $42  based on the remaining payroll  periods.  \\nSECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the \\nprior periods that  were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current \\npayroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid \\nonce a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be \\ndeducted from one p aycheck.  \\n9. An employee files his exemption certificate late. The employer has already withheld $52. \\nCan the employee  apply  for a refund?  \\nANSWER: Yes. The employee should request the refund from the employer. It is \\npermissible and recommended that his employe r refund the current year LST and make \\nan adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year.  \\nIf the employer does not refund the LST, the employee can apply for a refund from the \\nCity after the employer’s fourth quarter paymen t and summary form is filed at the end of \\nJanuary of the following year (see Section 301(j)).  \\nThe City is not required to pay interest until 75 days after the fourth quarter or when the \\ntaxpayer files for a refund, whichever is later.   -7-  10. Employe e works 4 months in the City and earns $20,000. His employer  is  located \\noutside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Is the employee required to pay the $52 \\nLST?  \\nANSWER:   Yes. \\n11. Is a self -employed person or a  partner who has an office in the City or who works out  \\nof his home  located in the City subject to the  LST?  \\nANSWER:  Yes.   A self -employed person or partner is subject to the $52   LST.  The \\ntax may be  prorated and paid  quarterly.  \\n \\nARTICLE III \\nCOLLECTION AT SOUR CE \\nSECTION 301 – COLLECTION THROUGH EMPLOYERS  \\na. Every employer not registered with the City shall, within 15 days after first becoming an \\nemployer, register with the City the employer’s name, address and such other information \\nas the City may  require.  \\nb. All em ployers and self -employed individuals are required to collect the Local Services Tax \\nfrom all employees engaged in an occupation within the City, unless the employee files  \\nan Exemption certificate with the employer. Exemption certificates must indicate a basis \\nfor exemption  and must  be retained  for 3 years.  \\nc. Employers are required to remit the Local Services Tax within thirty (30) days after the \\nend of each quarter of a calendar year. For purposes of this tax, sole proprietors and \\npartners  shall be deemed  to be employees.  \\nWHEN TO FILE AND PAY – The employer shall file a return of taxes deducted for each \\nthree -month period (quarter) on or before the last day of the month following each three - \\nmonth period.  \\nFIRST  QUARTER  (03):  January  1 thru March  31 (due April 30) \\nSECOND  QUARTER  (06):  April 1 thru June  30 (due July 31) \\nTHIRD  QUARTER  (09):  July 1 thru September  30 (due October  31) \\nFOURTH  QUARTER  (12):  October  1 thru December  31 (due January  31) \\nd.

The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the employee from the duty \\nto file a return and pay the tax. The employee must first contact the City of Pittsburgh \\nFinance Department at 412-255-2510 then file an LS -3 form. No employer shall be held \\nliable for failure to withhold the Local Services Tax to a political subdivision if the failure to \\nwithhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the \\nemployee’s place or places of employmen t. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as \\nrequired by this section, or who fails to pay the tax to the Treasurer,  shall be liable  for \\nsuch  tax in full.  -8-  As to employees who present official receipts evidencing prior payment of the tax either \\ndirectly or by collection through other employers in Pennsylvania, the employer shall not \\ndeduct the tax but shall maintain adequate records concerning the employees.  \\nf. The employer must list on the employee’s pay stub how much was withheld and list the \\nmunicipality it was paid to . List PITTSBURGH as  “PGH ”. \\ng. Upfront Exemption . Employers are required to discontinue withholding the LST if an \\nemployee provides an exemption certificate showing that he has earned income and/or \\nnet profits of less than $12,000. The exemption certificate must verify that the employee \\nreasonably expec ts to receive earned income and/or net profits of less than $12,000 from \\nall sources within the City for the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. \\nA copy of the employee’s final pay stubs or W -2 forms from employment within Pittsburgh  \\nfor the year prior to the calendar year for which the employee is requesting an exemption \\nmust be attached to the exemption certificate. Employers must make upfront exemption \\nforms readily available to employees at all times and provide new employees with  the \\nforms at the time of hiring. Employers are relieved of liability due to incorrect information \\non the exemption  certificate  completed  by the employee.  \\nEmployers are only required to withhold the LST on a payroll period basis for those \\npayroll periods i n which the taxpayer is employed. However, when two or more  employers \\nemploy a taxpayer in a payroll period, an employer is not required to withhold the LST if \\nthe taxpayer provides a pay stub from his/her principal employer accompanied by an \\nemployee stat ement of principal employment that the pay stub is from the taxpayer’s \\nprincipal employer and that the taxpayer will notify the employer of any change in \\nemployment.  Employers  are relieved  of liability  for the tax if they fail to withhold  the tax due \\nto incorrect information provided by the taxpayer regarding the taxpayer’s principal \\nemployer.  \\nh. Military Exemption . Employers must exempt from the LST: (1) members of a reserve \\ncomponent of the armed forces called to active duty and (2) honorably discha rged \\nveterans who served in any war or armed conflict who are blind, paraplegic, or a double \\nor quadruple amputee as a result of military service or who are 100% disabled from a \\nservice -connected  disability.  \\ni. Restoration of Withholding . Employers must “rest art” withholding the LST from an \\nemployee  who files an exemption  certificate  in the following  circumstances:  \\n\\uf0b7 If instructed  to do so by the political  subdivision  levying  the LST;  \\n\\uf0b7 If notified  by the employee  that he is no longer  eligible  for the exemption;  or \\n\\uf0b7 If the employer  pays  the employee  $12,000  or more  for the calendar  year.  \\nEmployers “restart” withholding of the LST by withholding (1) a “catch -up” lump sum  \\nequal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the employee as a result of the \\nexemption; and (2) the same amount per payroll period that is withheld from other \\nemployees.  \\nj. The employer must attach a summary on a CD or hard copy with the fourth quarter \\npayment  listing  the following  information:  \\n\\uf0b7 Employer’s name, address in Pittsburgh, Federal ID number, and the employer’s City \\naccount  number.   -9-  \\uf0b7 The summary must include an employee’s name, Social Security number, wages, \\naddress and the amount of Local Service Tax withheld and paid to Pittsburgh for the \\ncomplete calendar  year.  \\n\\uf0b7 Please see the LST tax form at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  for the format to \\nuse on  CD. \\n\\uf0b7 Concurrent Employment. If a taxpayer has two or more jobs in different political \\nsubdivisions during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the LST is as \\nfollows:  \\n1. Where  the taxpayer  maintains  his principal  office  or is principally  employed;  \\n2. Where  the taxpayer  resides  and works;  and \\n3. Where  the taxpayer  is employed  that is nearest  in miles  to the taxpayer’s  home.  \\nk. If any employer fails or refuses to pay over to the Treasurer any tax required to be \\nwithheld under this section by the due date, a penalty of 5% for every month or fraction \\nthereof that the tax remains unpaid shall be added and collected, the penalty is c apped at \\n50%. Interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum on the amount of tax unpaid \\nfor each month or fraction of a month that tax remains unpaid shall be added and \\ncollected.  \\nSECTION 302 – DIRECT PAYMENT BY TAXPAYER  \\nEvery taxpayer who is self -employed, a partner, or any taxpayer that did not have the tax \\nwithheld for any other reason, shall file a LS -3 form and shall pay the tax directly to the \\nTreasurer.  The tax is  $52 and should  be pro-rated  and paid on a quarterly  basis.  Taxpayers  shall \\nfile and pay the tax  30 days after the end of each quarter.  \\nSECTION 303 – LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES  \\nAny employer required to withhold the tax in accordance with the City Code and with these \\nRegulations shall be personally liable for paymen t of the tax in the event he fails, refuses or \\nneglects to withhold or transmit the tax or any portion thereof, in addition to the interest and \\npenalties. Any taxes deducted and withheld from employees, plus any penalties and interest \\nthereon, constitute a  trust fund for the benefit of the City. The failure to timely remit such funds \\nallows the City to collect such trust funds from the employer, the employer’s representative, or \\nany other person receiving such trust funds.  53 P.S. § 6924.705(b)(1).  \\nThe failure or omission of any employer to make the correct deductions required by this section \\nshall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or the balance determined to be due, \\ntogether with penalty and interest from the date the tax was due , or from complying with the \\nrequirements of the Code relating to the filing of declarations and returns.  \\nARTICLE IV \\nADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT  \\nSECTION 401 – POWERS AND DUTIES OF TREASURER  \\na.

Such  action  may include  obtaining  additional  information, \\nauditing taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of the tax, or \\nobtaining liens on the taxpayer’s property, wage attachmen ts, levies, and seizures and sales \\nof the taxpayer’s  property  in appropriate  circumstances.  The Treasurer  may enter  into a written \\nagreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes \\nthat such an agreement will faci litate collection. The Treasurer may also impose interest and \\napplicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek criminal charges in appropriate \\ncircumstances.

The limitations set forth in paragraph (a) should not prevent the institution of a suit for \\nthe collection  of any tax due or determined  to be due in the following  cases:  \\n1. When  no return  was filed,  there  is no limitation.  \\n2. When  the return  is fraudulent,  there  is no limitation.  \\n3. When there is an understatement of tax liability of twenty -five percent (25%) or more, \\nand not due to fraud, suit must begin within six (6)  years.  \\nc. Deficiency  assessments  (i.e., where  taxpayer  has filed a return  in good  faith but is found \\nto owe additional tax) shall include taxes for three  (3) years prior to  the  date  when \\nthe deficiency is assessed. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to the \\nperiod of assessment. A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the \\ndue date.   -12-  SECTION 504 – PENALTY AND INTEREST  \\na. If for any reason the Local Services Tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate       \\nof twelve percent (12%) per annum on the amount of tax and an additional penalty of \\nfive percent (5%) per month for each month or fraction of a month during the perio d in \\nwhich the tax remains unpaid shall be added to the tax. 53 P.S. § 6924.706.

A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is hereby  imposed  upon  each  \\nparking  transaction  by a patron  of a non-residential  parking  place  at the rate of \\nthirty -seven  and one-half (37.5)  percent  for all transactions  occurring  on or after \\nJanuary  1, 2009.  The rate of tax may be changed  for any tax year by the \\nlegislative  actions  of the Mayor and City Council.   However, the tax rate may not \\nexceed the rate permitted by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and \\nRecovery Act , 53 P.S. § 895.902.  \\n \\n(b) Calculation  of tax. The following  method  must  be used  to compute  the tax, \\nwhether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  \\nindividual  tax collections  are not kept for each  ticket :  \\n \\nSimplified Calculation .  For ease of administration and tax collection,  the tax \\nreturn presumes that gross collections include both total consideration from the \\npatron and collected parking tax  from the patron . Under this simplified \\ncalculation the applicable tax rates is 27.273% times gross collections.  \\n \\n The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as follows:  \\n \\nParking  Fee X Tax Rate  = Parking  Tax Due \\n \\nFor example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%:  \\n \\n$1,000.00  X 37.5%  = $375.00  \\n$1,550.00  X 37.5%  = $581.25  \\n \\n(c) Calculation  of total  payment.  The following  method  shall be used  to compute  \\nthe total payment  collected  by the  operator  and paid by the  patron,  whether  the tax \\ntotal is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are \\nnot kept for each  ticket.  The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as \\nfollows:  \\n \\nParking  Fee + Parking  Tax = Total  Payment  \\n \\nFor example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%:  \\n$1,000.00  + $375.00  = $1,375.00  \\n$1,550.00  + $581.25  = $2,131.25  \\n \\n(d) Calculation  of total  payment where  there  is a surcharge.  The following method  \\nshall be used  to compute  the total payment  collected  by the operator  and paid by \\nthe patron  when  a surcharge  is imposed,  whether  the tax total is taken  from \\nindividual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each  \\nticket.  The parking  tax will be applied  to the sum of the base  parking  fee and the \\nsurcharge.  The rate of  tax is defined above  and will be applied  as follows:  \\n  -11-  (Base  Fee + Surcharge)   + Tax Rate(Base Fee  + Surcharge) = Total  Payment  \\n \\nFor example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%  and the surcharge  is $10: \\n($1,000.00  + $10.00)  + $378.75  = $1,388.75  \\n($1,550.00  + $10.00)  + $585.00  = $2,145.00  \\n \\n§ 302.  COLLECTION  OF TAX.  \\n \\n(a) Collection  by operator  or provider .  A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is imposed  \\nupon  each  patron  entering into  a parking transaction,  at the specified  rate of  the \\nconsideration for each such  transaction,  which  tax shall be collected by the operator  \\nfrom the patron,  and shall be paid over to the Treasurer as set forth in Chapter 253  \\nof the Pittsburgh  Code.  \\n \\n(b) Creation  of a trust.  All taxes  collected by any operator in accordance  with the \\nPittsburgh  Code,  Chapter 253  shall constitute a trust fund for the benefit  of the City \\nand such trust  shall be enforceable  against  the operator  and any person  receiving  \\nany part of such  fund without  consideration,  or with knowledge  that the operator is  \\ncommitting a breach  of trust;  provided  however,  that any person  receiving payment  \\nof a lawful  obligation  of the operator  from such fund shall be presumed  to have  \\nreceived  the same  in good faith and  without  any knowledge  of the  breach of  trust.  \\n \\n(c) Liability  of the  operator.

Moreover,  use \\nof any or all of the remedies  provided  in these  Sections  does  not preclude  the use by the \\nCity of any other  legal  or administrative  procedure  which  can bring  about  compliance  by \\nthe operator with  the provisions  of the  Code  and these Regulations.  \\n \\nOnce it has been determined that that a taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all \\nactions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional \\ninformation, auditing taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of \\nthe tax, or obtaining liens on the taxpayer’s property, wage attachments, levies, and \\nseizures and sales of  the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer \\nmay enter into a written agreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments \\nif the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer \\nmay also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek criminal \\ncharges in appropriate circumstances.

PENALTY  AND  INTEREST.  \\n \\n(a) If for any reason the  Parking Tax is not paid in  whole or in part  when  due, a penalty  \\nat the rate of five percent  (5%) per month  of the amount  of the Parking Tax will be \\nadded  and collected  as penalty  for every  month  or fraction  thereof  during the time \\nthe Parking Tax  goes  unpaid,  such  penalty  not to  exceed fifty  percent  (50%).  \\nOnce  due and owing,  penalty  becomes  part of the Parking Tax.  \\n \\n(b) In addition to the penalty,  interest  of one percent  (1%)  for every  month  or fraction  \\nthereof  will be added to  the delinquent  tax balance  which  will continue  to accrue  \\nuntil the full  payment  of the tax principal  is made.   In no event shall the interest rate \\nassessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens \\nAct, 53 P.S. 7143, or applic able law.  \\n \\n(c) On any additional  Parking Fee  determined to be due as a result  of a deficiency  \\nnotice,  penalty  and interest  will be assessed from  the day the Parking Tax should  \\nhave  been  paid to the date of payment.  Penalty  and interests  are calculated  in \\nSection 602(a) and 602(b),  respectively.  \\n \\n(d) Where  suit is brought  for the recovery  of the Parking Tax,  the person  liable therefor  \\nshall,  in addition,  be liable for the costs  of collection , penalties,  and interest  herein  \\nimposed.  \\n \\n(e) A person’s  belief  that no Parking  Tax is due and owing,  or the failure of  any person  \\nto receive  or obtain the forms required  for making the returns  required  by the Code  \\nis not a valid defense to  the imposition  of penalties  for violation herein.

The \\nMayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council’s nine representatives are elected to \\noffice by residents in each of their respective districts.\\nThe Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or \\nfraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with \\nreporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City’s fiscal condition. Every \\nyear, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information \\non Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook.\\nCity Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also \\napproves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital \\nBudgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of \\nCity government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.\\nCity Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The \\nCity Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information \\nresource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget \\nDivision monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations.  It prepares and distributes \\nto Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City \\nof Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council\\'s annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special \\nreports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.\\nThe Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly \\nresponsible for much of the City’s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices, \\nBureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to \\ndebt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law \\nacts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella \\norganizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire, \\nEmergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and \\nSafety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations, \\nEnvironmental Services, and Facilities.\\nAdditionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial \\nhierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City’s General Fund. For this reason, these \\nAuthorities are not included in the Operating Budget.\\nA comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart \\npresented in this document. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\\n19 What is the Operating Budget?\\nThe Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are \\nfigures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are \\nspread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the \\nadministration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public \\nsafety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and \\nprogramming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the \\nroutine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’ \\ncompensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.\\nThe City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are \\ncollected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses, \\ncharges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other \\nrevenue generating mechanisms. \\nThe Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what \\ngovernmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal \\nyear. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in \\ndelivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.\\nThe Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and \\nMembers of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the \\nCity of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of \\nPittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire \\nthrough tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must \\nprioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the \\nCity. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits \\npriorities set by the City’s elected public officials.\\nFinally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of \\nPittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the \\nCity of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating \\nBudget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial \\ncreation of the plan.\\nBasis of Accounting\\nThe General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh \\nrecognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.\\nThe Fiscal Year\\nThe City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of \\neach year. This can only be changed by ordinance.\\nBalanced Budget Mandate\\nThe City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues \\nequal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, \\nthe budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\\n20 The City’s Fund Structure\\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on \\na fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.\\n Governmental Funds\\nGeneral Fund\\nCapital Projects Fund\\nCommunity Development Funds\\nSpecial Revenues Funds\\nFiduciary Funds\\nPension Trust Fund\\nAgency Funds\\nThe General Fund  is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain \\nmost of the City’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general \\nadministration.\\nThe Capital Projects Fund  is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or \\nprogram (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to \\nprovide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum \\nvalue of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from \\nthree major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on \\nthe Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document.\\nCommunity Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban \\nDevelopment (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and \\nhuman services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.\\nSpecial Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or \\ncommitted for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership \\nFund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for \\ntwo of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word \\n“trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the \\nfunds are not held by any trustees or custodians.\\n \\nFiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These \\nresources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature. The \\nCity’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.\\n• The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for \\nfirefighters, and a third for municipal employees.\\n• Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax \\nrefunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other \\nPost-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of \\nFiduciary Funds.\\nBudget Allocations\\nThis budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that \\ncomprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\\n21 The City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and \\nElected Office.

There are seven subclasses.\\n Revenues\\n41  Tax Revenue\\n42  License and Permit Revenue\\n43  Charges for Services\\n44  Fines and Forfeitures\\n45  Intergovernmental Revenue\\n46  Interest Earnings\\n47  Miscellaneous Revenues\\nTax Revenue\\nTaxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are \\nmany that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City. \\nThey are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.\\nReal estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School \\nDistrict, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within \\nthe City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property \\nAssessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2023, the City real estate \\ntax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax \\nrate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny \\nCounty Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).\\nOther sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax, \\nthe Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the \\nDeed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax. \\nEarned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn \\nwages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2 \\npercent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security, \\nand capital gains are commonly excluded.\\nThe Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied \\nat the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed \\nindividuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide \\nservices within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\\n23 Finally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of \\nPittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051.\\nIn 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total City revenue.\\nCity of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for \\nthe improvement of the City\\'s parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Stop \\nthe Violence Trust Fund  section for more information.\\nNon-tax Revenue\\n“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not \\ndirectly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction \\npermits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as \\ninterest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue \\nfor the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.\\nEach year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of \\ngrants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account \\nconsists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most \\nintergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local \\nentities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal \\nagencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City\\'s goal is to enhance the \\nquality of municipal services and reduce the City\\'s financial burden. \\nMany City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees \\ninclude payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale \\nof rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and \\ngovernmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to \\nreceive medical care.\\nIn 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total City revenue.\\nHow Does the City Spend Money?\\nThe tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents \\nranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by \\ndepartment or division and by subclass.\\nMajor expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City \\nof Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past \\nand current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs.

Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of \\nFinance and is composed of the following accounts:\\n Debt Service\\n82101  Interest Expense - Bonds\\n82103  Principal\\nBudget Creation Process\\nThe operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget \\n(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations, \\npolicy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by \\nCity Code.\\nAfter receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit \\nproposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements, \\nrequests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the \\nproposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if \\nany, should be funded.\\nThe Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to \\ngarner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor’s \\nstrategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.\\nCity Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After \\nconsideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a \\nvote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st.  Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of \\nthe new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to \\ncollective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before \\nDecember 31st was 1931.  \\nUpon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating and \\nCapital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City’s expenditures and revenues, provides \\nlegislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments. \\nAnalysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure \\ncategories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important \\nmanagement initiatives.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\\n26 Five-Year Financial Forecast\\nIn addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both \\nexpenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise \\nthe five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.\\nThe five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This \\naids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-\\nterm impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for \\nlong-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might \\nresult in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus \\nensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.\\nRevenue Forecast\\nRevenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and \\ndeliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the \\nrights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \\nProjected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.\\nThe Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts. \\nPrevious years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-\\nyear financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning \\n(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue \\nline. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.\\nIn addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic \\nvariables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue \\ngenerating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the \\nBureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the \\nNational Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.\\nRevenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of \\nPittsburgh’s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are \\ndeveloped in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are \\nreasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections \\nare finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.\\nExpenditure Forecast\\nOMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these \\nforecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known \\nexpenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension \\ncontributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).\\nOMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and \\ninitiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are \\nsubject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This \\nis accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,\\nLastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described \\nabove. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in \\nachieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests \\nand evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that \\nfall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\\n27 How to Read the Budget\\nThroughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate \\nsection of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference \\nbetween each report within a section. \\nDepartmental Sections\\nThe most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in \\nthe Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been \\nappropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the \\nDepartmental Sections of the Operating Budget. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\\n28 Organization Chart\\nThe organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau, \\nor Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with \\nthe exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.\\nDepartmental Overview\\nAt the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the \\norganization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the \\ndepartment. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency, \\nBureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.\\nPosition Summary\\nThe position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or “FTE,” \\nrepresents the number of full-time workers in the position. The “Rate/Grade” category indicates how an \\nemployee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees \\ncan be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a “12” in the “Hours/Months” column \\nindicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or \\nending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The \\n“Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The \\n“Vacancy Allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions \\nthroughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons.\\nSubclass Detail\\nThis portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass \\nand object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight \\nthe appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “Administrative Fees,” “Workforce Training,” and \\n“Computer Maintenance.” Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted \\nexpenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024 \\nbudgeted amounts.\\nUnder the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular  salary represents \\nthe total base pay for the organization. Longevity  pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining \\nagreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances  are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or \\nseasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform  allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs \\nare listed accordingly. Leave Buyback  represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium \\nPay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements  are funds from outside sources that are \\nused to offset certain position expenses.\\nFive-Year Forecasts\\nFinally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to \\nthe 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included \\nas a reference point.\\nNote for Fund Accounts\\nFor special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2024 summary is \\ncomposed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and \\nthe “Projected Ending Balance” for December 31, 2024. These funds carry over from year to year.

The forecasts are based on economic assumptions, recent collection trends, and \\ncurrent laws and policies. However, actual revenues could vary from forecasts due to unforeseeable economic \\nand technical factors.\\n2024 Operating Budget Revenue\\nRevenues are divided into tax and non-tax revenues. In 2024, tax revenues are budgeted at approximately $541.8 \\nmillion and non-tax revenues are budgeted at $172.4 million, comprising approximately 75.9 percent and 24.1 \\npercent of total revenues, respectively. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.5 percent in 2024 over the \\n2023 budget. \\nTax Revenue\\nTax revenues incorporate all major taxes that are levied by the City of Pittsburgh. For each tax, total revenues \\ninclude current year collections, prior year collections and penalties and interest. Tax revenues are forecast to \\nincrease by 1.2 percent in 2024 over the 2023 budget and to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.\\nReal Estate Tax\\nTotal real estate tax revenues are budgeted at $151.8 million in 2024, an estimated 4.7 percent decrease from the \\nprior year. The real estate tax is the largest source of revenue in the 2024 Operating Budget, comprising \\napproximately 28.0 percent of tax revenues and 21.3 percent of total revenues. Current year real estate tax \\nliability (the amount billed at the beginning of the year) is calculated by applying the millage rate (8.06 mils) to \\nAllegheny County\\'s assessed value of property. On average, residential property comprises approximately 55 \\npercent of the total assessed value of property in the City of Pittsburgh and non-residential property comprises \\napproximately 45 percent. Prior to the county-wide reassessment effective in 2013, the total assessed value of \\nproperty in the City grew by approximately 1.2 percent on average per year since 2003. The county-wide \\nreassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total assessed value decreased \\nby 7.8 percent in 2014. Since then, the total assessed value of property has grown by 1.1 percent on average per \\nyear, more in line with historical growth. \\nThe largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the \\nAllegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2 \\npercent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax.  Real estate tax incentives for future years are \\nestimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment. Total real estate tax \\nrevenues are forecast to increase by 0.8 percent each year through 2028.\\nEarned Income Tax\\nTotal earned income tax revenues are budgeted at $136.2 million in 2024, an estimated 7.3 percent increase over \\nthe prior year. The earned income tax is a 1.25 percent levy on the wages and net profits of residents of the City \\nof Pittsburgh. The earned income tax forecast projects tax year liabilities based on a 3.0 percent growth rate, with \\na downward adjustment for the City of Pittsburgh, and splits current and prior year liabilities based on historical \\ncollections. Total earned income tax revenues are forecast to increase by 4.4 percent each year through 2028.  \\nPayroll Preparation Tax\\nTotal payroll preparation tax revenues are budgeted at $76.3 million in 2024, an estimated 16.0 percent increase \\nover the prior year. The payroll preparation tax is levied at a rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers \\nand net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations and joint ventures who \\nperform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh.  Non-profits an exempt from this tax. The payroll City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  \\nFiscal Year 2024  Revenue\\n40 preparation tax forecast uses total non-farm wages for Allegheny County to forecast future revenues. Total non-\\nfarm wages for Allegheny County are forecast to increase by 4.0 percent on average. Total payroll preparation tax \\nrevenues are forecast to increase by 2.2 percent each year through 2028.\\nParking Tax\\nTotal parking tax revenues are budgeted at $51.6 million in 2024, a 1.9 percent decrease from the prior year. The \\nparking tax is levied at a rate of 37.5 percent on fees charged for parking or storing cars within the City of \\nPittsburgh. The parking tax forecast uses a multivariate regression with collections as the dependent variable and \\nthe tax rate and gross Allegheny County product as independent variables. Estimated gross Allegheny County \\nproduct is the total value of goods produced and services provided in the county, and serves as a broad economic \\nindicator of activity in and around the City. Total parking tax revenues are forecast to increase by 3.7 percent each \\nyear through 2028. \\nDeed Transfer Tax\\nDeed transfer tax revenues are budgeted at $59.1 million in 2024, an estimated 13.7 percent decrease compared \\nwith the prior year. This decrease is related to fewer property transactions in comparison to last year as a result of \\nrising interest rates.  The tax is levied at a rate of 3 percent on real property transfers within the City of Pittsburgh. \\nThe total tax paid, which is typically split between the buyer and seller of a property, is 5% as of 2020, as the state \\nand school board each also levy 1% taxes of their own.  \\nThe deed transfer tax forecast (provided by IHS Markit) uses a multivariate regression with collections as the \\ndependent variable and three independent variables. The first independent variable is the residential tax base, \\nwhich consists of existing single-family home sales multiplied by the average price of an existing single-family \\nhome. The other independent variables are the tax rate and a dummy variable for years in which the sale of a \\nnon-residential property exceeded $100 million. Total deed transfer tax revenues are forecast to increase by 1.2 \\npercent on average each year over the next five years.\\nRegional Asset District Tax Relief\\nRegional Asset District tax relief is budgeted at $25.8 million in 2024, an estimated 3.3 percent increase over the \\nprior year. This relief, created by Pennsylvania Act 77 of 1993, provides the City of Pittsburgh with a percentage of \\n1/4 of the 1 percent additional sales tax in Allegheny County. The City of Pittsburgh’s percentage is determined by \\na formula that compares the City’s tax revenues and the market value of property per capita with that of all \\nmunicipalities in Allegheny County. Retail sales (a proxy for sales tax collections) are forecast to grow by 3.1 \\npercent on average over the same period. Act 77 tax relief is forecast to increase by 2.0 percent each year \\nthrough 2028.\\nAmusement Tax\\nTotal amusement tax revenues are budgeted at $18.9 million in 2024, an estimated 9.2 percent increase over the \\nprior year. The amusement tax is levied at a rate of 5 percent on the gross admission to events that provide \\nentertainment within the City of Pittsburgh, excluding non-profit performing arts organizations. Amusement tax \\ncollections are primarily motivated by sporting events within the City. Revenues from the three professional sports \\nteams have historically comprised 70 percent of amusement tax revenues on average per year. Revenues from \\nopposing teams and non-resident performers comprise the remainder of the amusement tax revenues. A sports \\nteams and clubs economic indicator is used to forecast 70 percent of amusement tax revenues. The remaining 30 \\npercent is forecast with consumer price index (inflation) to generate a more conservative forecast. Total \\namusement tax revenues are forecast to increase by 2.6 percent each year through 2028.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  \\nFiscal Year 2024  Revenue\\n41 Local Service Tax\\nTotal local service tax revenues are budgeted at $15.7 million in 2024, an estimated 3.2 percent increase over the \\nprior year. The local service tax is a weekly tax of $1 per employee working within the City of Pittsburgh earning \\ngreater than $12,000 annually. The local service tax forecast uses annual employment forecasts for the City of \\nPittsburgh to project revenues. Total local service tax revenues are forecast to decrease by 0.6 percent per year \\nthrough 2028.\\nNon-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee\\nTo offset the revenue loss from phasing out the tax on non-profit performing arts organizations, the non-resident \\nsports facility usage fee was established in 2005. Total non-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are \\nbudgeted at $4.4 million in 2024, an estimated 99.3 percent increase over the prior year. The fee is 3 percent of \\nthe earned income generated by non-residents using a publicly funded facility to engage in an athletic event or \\nperformance.  This results in a conservative forecast with growth slightly above the consumer price index. Total \\nnon-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are forecast to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.\\nTelecommunication Licensing Fee\\nThe telecommunication licensing fee is budgeted at $1.2 million in 2024, a 26.5 percent decrease compared with \\nthe prior year. The fee is levied on telecommunications companies for the privilege of running lines under public \\nstreets, bridges and sidewalks. Total telecommunication licensing fee collections are forecast to increase by 1.0 \\npercent each year through 2028.\\nInstitution and Service Privilege Tax\\nThe institution and service privilege tax is budgeted at $460,644 in 2024, an estimated 16.8 percent decrease \\nover the prior year. The tax is levied on the gross income of foundations, partnerships and non-profit organizations \\nthat provide a public service. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.7 percent each year through 2028, \\nroughly in line with inflation. \\nNon-Profit Payments for Services\\nNon-profit payments for services are contractual payments from the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for \\nsome of their properties that have been taken off the tax rolls. The total budget for this line item is $438,891 in \\n2024.\\nOutdoor Advertising Excise Tax\\nCity Council enacted an outdoor advertising excise tax in 2013. This tax on billboards was estimated to bring in \\n$1.2 to $2.0 million dollars annually to the City. This tax is currently in litigation; no tax revenue has been collected \\nby the City.  \\nNon-Tax Revenues\\nNon-tax revenues are divided into six categories: licenses and permits, charges for service, fines and forfeitures, \\nintergovernmental revenue, interest earnings, and miscellaneous revenues. Non-tax revenues are forecast to \\nincrease by 6.9 percent in 2024 over the prior year and decrease by 6.1 percent each year through 2028.\\nLicenses and Permits\\nTotal revenues for the licenses and permits category are budgeted at $17.1 million in 2024, an estimated 7.2 \\npercent increase over the prior year. Licenses account for 5.0 percent of this revenue and permits account for \\n94.7 percent 2024. Licenses are issued to businesses and vendors for a variety of purposes (e.g., poker \\nmachines, parking lots, and pool tables).

The City plans to achieve these by:\\n• Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services\\n• Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations\\n• Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and \\nprovide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases\\n• Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary\\nThe 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and \\nimprove the City’s long-term fiscal health by:\\n• Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated \\nminimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC)\\n• Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of General \\nFund expenditures in 2024\\n• Allocating a $22.0 million in \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan\\nIn addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key \\ncomponents and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following:\\n• Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase \\nworkplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost \\nmanagement initiative.\\n• Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees, \\nworkers\\' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer \\ncontributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few \\nyears, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget \\nFiscal Year 2024 Expenditures\\n53 health and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension \\nfunding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.\\n• Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required \\ncosts that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across \\neach department. \\n• Debt Service: The forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in \\n2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City’s critical infrastructure \\nneeds.\\n• PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the \\nCapital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on \\ncapital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2024 Capital \\nImprovement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement, \\neconomic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to \\ncontribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing \\n$22 million in 2024 and a total of $21.1 million from 2025 to 2028.\\nMost non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout \\nfiscal year 2028. Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027.\\n2024-2028 Spending by Subclass\\n51 Personnel-Salaries & Wages\\n52 Personnel-Employee Benefits\\n53 Professional & Technical Services\\n54 Property Services\\n55 Other Services\\n56 Supplies\\n57 Property\\n58 Miscellaneous\\n82 Debt Service\\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028$0$200,000,000$400,000,000$600,000,000$800,000,000\\nThe 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan achieves substantial improvements in terms of the percentage of \\ntotal expenditures related to debt service.

In the 2024 Operating Budget, total \\nplanned expenditures related to debt service is $69,390,272, or 10.1 percent of total budgeted expenditures.

In addition to the advanced life support units the bureau also staffs four basic life \\nsupport ambulances staffed by Pennsylvania Department of Health Certified Emergency Medical Technicians. \\nStrategically located throughout the City, the Bureau will operate thirteen advanced life support (ALS) and three \\nbasic life support (BLS) ambulances 24 hours per day when at full staffing capacity.\\n \\nWith advanced training and technology, the Bureau of EMS is delivering cutting-edge care by providing new \\ntreatment modalities that allow for more effective recognition and treatment of heart attacks, strokes, cardiac \\narrest, and a number of other life threatening conditions. For patients experiencing ST Elevation Myocardial \\nInfarction (STEMI), EMS has the ability to screen and directly transmit an EKG to the receiving hospital and \\nactivate the cardiac cauterization laboratory prior to arrival, greatly reducing the time to definitive treatment.\\nThe Bureau of EMS also provides integrated medically-directed rescue for vehicle accidents, industrial accidents, \\nhigh and low angle rope rescues, confined space emergencies, building collapse, elevator emergencies, and \\nothers. The base service is comprised of two specially equipped rescue trucks, each staffed by two paramedics, \\noperating 24 hours a day. All Pittsburgh Paramedics are trained and certified for vehicle and basic rescue \\npractices. Those paramedics assigned to the Rescue Division receive additional rescue training and certifications.  \\nThe Bureau of EMS is also an integral part of three joint public safety teams: River Rescue, SWAT, and the \\nHazardous Materials (Hazmat) Team. For each team, EMS provides an administrative and leadership role as well \\nas a cadre of highly qualified personnel and instructors. \\nFor River Rescue, EMS provides two Paramedic Public Safety SCUBA divers to staff the units. The Bureau of \\nPolice assigns an officer/helmsman who provides a law enforcement component to the units. This unit conducts \\nport security and safety patrols on a routine basis. \\nFor the SWAT Team, EMS provides trained Tactical EMS (TEMS) personnel who have undergone all of the \\nrequired SWAT training in addition to specialized treatment under fire training. They respond as an integral \\nelement of the SWAT Team to multiple incidents such as barricaded persons, high risk warrants, and dignitary \\nprotection.\\nFor the Hazmat Team, EMS participates with the Bureaus of Fire and Police, providing personnel trained and \\ncertified to the Technician level for entry, evaluation, mitigation, and decontamination. EMS also provides the \\nrequired medical monitoring for pre-entry and post-entry for an incident.\\nThe Bureau of Emergency Medical Services also provides the following services to the community:\\n• Special Event coverage (Heinz Field, PNC Park, PPG Paints Arena, etc.) averages 90 events per month \\nusing ambulances, EMS motorcycles, bicycles, boats, and medical carts\\n• First aid and CPR/AED training\\n• Child car seat inspection and education program \\n• Opioid harm reduction programs including Narcan leave behind and referral to treatment services\\n• Envelope of Life (EOL) program \\n• Stroke awareness\\n• Community and senior center visits for vital sign and glucose evaluations\\n• High school career daysCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Bureau of Emergency Medical Services\\nFiscal Year 2024  220000\\n165 • Middle school mentoring program\\n• Pittsburgh Public Schools Emergency Response Technology Education\\n• Diversity recruitment campaign\\n• Vaccination clinics (PODS) for influenza and pneumonia\\n• Clinical field education to paramedic students in the University of Pittsburgh Emergency Medicine \\nProgram \\n• Clinical field education to emergency medicine physician residents in the University of Pittsburgh \\nEmergency Medicine Residency program \\n \\n2023 Accomplishments\\n \\n• Financial Accomplishments:\\n◦ Income from transports increased by $1.8M from same time period last year\\n◦ Bureau slated to bring in an additional $5M in revenue for 2023\\n• Personnel Accomplishments:\\n◦ 6 new River Rescue Divers went through intensive training and all successfully completed the \\nclass\\n◦ Increase in promotions to upper administration\\n• Employee Safety Initiatives: \\n◦ Implementation of Cordico App for employee wellness\\n◦ Access control security system installed in all EMS facilities \\n• Equipment Initiatives:\\n◦ Bureau was approved to receive state of the art mannequins to simulate real life patients during \\nemergencies\\n◦ Billing company to purchase equipment/medication dispensary machines to be located in 5 areas \\nacross the City for faster crew retrieval of equipment leading to better turn around times and less \\nwaste of expired medications\\n• Clinical Accomplishments:\\n◦ Cardiac Arrest Care (through August 2023) - 13% survival to discharge\\n◦ Penetrating Trauma (through September 2023) - 93.3%\\n◦ Rescue Medicine Program (through October 2023) - 50 patients extricated via Pittsburgh EMS \\nRescue UnitsCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Bureau of Emergency Medical Services\\nFiscal Year 2024  220000\\n166 Position Summary\\n2023 Rate/ Hours/ 2023 2024 Rate/ Hours/ 2024\\nTitle FTE Grade Month\\nsBudget FTE Grade Month\\nsBudget\\nEMS Chief  1  137,279  12 $ 137,279  1  141,397  12 $ 141,397 \\nDeputy Chief  1  127,694  12  127,694  1  131,525  12  131,525 \\nAssistant Chief  1  120,364  12  120,364  1  123,975  12  123,975 \\nDivision Chief  3  110,944  12  332,832  3  114,272  12  342,817 \\nPatient Care Coordinator  1  47.82  12  99,472  —  —  —  — \\nOperations Safety Chief  —  —  —  —  1  49.36  12  102,670 \\nDistrict Chief  10  47.82  2,184  1,044,452  10  49.36  2,184  1,078,040 \\nCrew Chief  37  39.13  2,080  3,011,314  39  39.13  2,080  3,174,088 \\nParamedic  135 see below  2,080  9,208,097  133 see below  2,080  9,180,516 \\nSenior Emergency Medical Technician  4  20.95  2,080  174,314  6  20.95  2,080  261,471 \\nEmergency Medical Technician  24  20.62  2,080  1,029,400  22  20.62  2,080  943,617 \\nTotal Uniformed Employees 217 $ 15,285,218 217 $ 15,480,116 \\nAssistant I, Administrative  2 U02-G  12 $ 74,838  2 U02-G  12 $ 77,084 \\nTotal Full-Time Positions & Net Salaries  219 $ 15,360,056  219 $ 15,557,200 \\nFAPP Paramedic Hourly Rates 2023\\nParamedic - 5th Year $ 36.3806 \\nParamedic - 4th Year 32.3515\\nParamedic - 3rd Year 28.5206\\nParamedic - 2nd Year 24.6500\\nParamedic - 1st Year 24.6500\\nThe labor contract for FAPP members expires on December 31, 2023.

Through partnerships and program development, \\nthe Office will focus on:\\nDeveloping a Continuum of Support:  Through continued collaboration with first responders and community \\nmembers, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and \\nevaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of \\nresources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public \\nSafety partners.  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis \\nwill be utilized to build this continuum.\\nImplementation of Public Health-Informed Practices:  Public Safety personnel consistently respond to \\ncommunity needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders \\nhave significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being.  OCH&S will work with \\nthe Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and \\nresponses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by \\ncommunity members.  Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate \\ntranslational experiences.\\nConsistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and \\naccountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the \\ncurrent response continuum.  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, \\nprioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth.  OCH&S will \\npartner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and \\nmay not engage in traditional meetings.  Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives \\nfocused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.\\nNote: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.\\n City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget                                Office of Community Health and Safety\\nFiscal Year 2024  102300\\n196 2023 Accomplishments\\n• Launch of Co-Response in 2023 in Police Zones 1 & 2, which includes Downtown Pittsburgh.

The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide \\nindependent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  To accomplish this assignment, the Board \\nwill thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations; \\nevaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices \\nthrough public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor \\nand Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.\\nA Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the \\nstaff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and \\nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.\\nDepartmental/Bureau Overview\\nInvestigation and Complaint Disposition  - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the \\nCPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake \\nCoordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of \\nthe complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the \\ncomplaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a \\npreliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides \\ndaily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and \\nthe results are presented to the Board.  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an \\ninvestigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through \\ninvestigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion.  Findings and recommendations resulting from public \\nhearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board.  Patterns emerging from \\ncomplaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy \\nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.\\nCommunity Education  - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens \\nand police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and \\ncivilian expectations of police conduct.  Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and \\npersonal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s \\nrole and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the \\npublic is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen \\nand the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as \\noffensive.  The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the \\nprocess, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.\\nBoard and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance, \\nincluding police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human \\nrights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior.  Staff training \\nis designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops \\nmediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards \\nand performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.\\nAdministrative - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board \\nand those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board.  Activities \\nof this core service include the planning, organization, development, evaluation, and implementation of efficient \\nand effective management strategies of fiscal, personnel, information systems, and related support to maximize \\nthe utility of the resources available.

The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, \\nand improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.\\nThe Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to \\nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City’s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant \\nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our \\ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain \\ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed \\nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, \\nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows \\nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the \\nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.\\nIn 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects \\nsupported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding \\nto rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield \\nBridge supported by a State grant award.. \\nNew Grants by Department, Office, or Bureau\\n7.2%\\n4.9%\\n4.4%\\n0.3%\\n0.3%\\n0.8%\\n10.4%\\n52.7%18.9%\\nDPW\\nBudget\\nInnovation and Performance\\nPlanning\\nMayor\\'s Office\\nPolice\\nFire\\nOCHS\\nPublic Safety -

       "  'content': 'Carnegie Mellon University — — — Search Search CMU › About ›\\xa0             History Andrew Carnegie A self-educated \"working boy\" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world\\'s largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century. Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that \"to die rich is to die disgraced.\" He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. \"My heart is in the work,\" he stated, which would become part of the school\\'s official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. Carnegie Tech – Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor\\'s degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or \"Carnegie Tech.\" During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the \\'Carnegie Plan\\' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948: The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business , focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science. 1968: School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the H. John Heinz III College , providing graduate training for work in the public sector. 1986: School of Computer Science , pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences . In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery. A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda. The Future CMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900. At the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU research, innovation and creativity will continue to guide our future as a world-class university. As outlined in the Strategic Plan 2025 , the university will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.

       "  'content': 'Carnegie Mellon University — — — Search Search CMU › About ›\\xa0             Traditions Traditions Dating back more than a century, some Carnegie Mellon University traditions have a Scottish flavor (The Kiltie Band) as a nod to founder Andrew Carnegie. Other experiences blossomed from the minds of students (The Fence). Kiltie Band This kilt-clad student marching band — the self-named \" Band Without Pants \" — has entertained home football games with songs, chants, cheers and a quirky sense of humor since 1922. The Fence The Fence is painted between midnight and sunrise by students who then stand guard as long as they want their message to stay. Fun Fact: The original Fence was once the \"most painted object in the world\" until it collapsed and was replaced by a steel-concrete fence. Spring Carnival The entire community comes together for this four-day festival, Carnegie Mellon\\'s oldest tradition. Buggy Sweepstakes A Spring Carnival highlight, students race \" buggies ,\" often reaching up to 35 mph. Student groups design and build the aerodynamic cylinders — \"pushmobiles,\" as they were called when the tradition started in 1920. Bagpipers It doesn\\'t get more Scottish than bagpipes. Carnegie Mellon\\'s Pipes and Drums can be found practicing around campus and performing at formal university events.

This commitment drives our pursuit of creating a space where every voice can be heard. We seek to cultivate diverse populations and perspectives and promote equity and inclusion. Our devotion to these ideals springs from a core belief in the power of education to be a transformative and enriching force for every person, irrespective of their background, identity or life circumstances. Inclusion and belonging are intricately interwoven into the very essence of our university, helping to shape our values, policies and practices. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are not only central to our ethos but also indispensable to our pursuit of academic excellence and innovation. Let\\'s continue on this journey together. Contact Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer 412-268-4744 vp-dei@andrew.cmu.edu Visit Website Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion 412-268-2150 csdi@andrew.cmu.edu Visit website Messages from Leadership \"Since our founding, Carnegie Mellon University has been committed to promoting academic excellence and economic mobility through education. Succeeding on this front requires us to both expand access and remove barriers to opportunity in pursuit of a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. These efforts are ongoing and remain critical to our university\\'s mission to advance learning, research, and creativity and make a positive impact on society more broadly.\" Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President\\'s Chair “As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values.” Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in society’s opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries. Others make a more serious effort at collecting information. Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective. The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent. For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek. Those will include some objective information, which you can find on the pages of the Carnegie Mellon University website, or on sites for which CMU provides information, such as IPEDS College Navigator or collegedata.com . Your decision should also take into account your own assessment about programs, culture and opportunities for growth.

Love Your Wild Neighbor Public Service Announcement Video Baby Fawns Public Service Announcement Video Coyotes Public Service Announcement Video Love Dogs & Cats Public Service Announcement Video Description of Services: The Bureau of Animal Care & Control provides assistance to Bureaus within the Department of Public Safety, other City Departments and the Allegheny County Health Department in situations involving animals, both domestic and wild. The Bureau enforces City and State codes dealing with animals; issues citations and appears in court; helps to keep our City’s parks animal-nuisance free; works with non-profit animal shelters; provides consultation to other municipalities concerning animal issues; and assists the Pennsylvania Game Commission in tracking the rabies virus. Animal Care & Control Officers\\xa0capture stray animals, assist in pet/owner recovery, resolve neighbor disputes over animals, assist the elderly and physically-challenged with animal concerns, advise and teach residents of their responsibility as pet owners, advise non-pet owners of their rights, and assist in the removal of nuisance wildlife. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks.\\xa0The Bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the District Attorney\\'s office with humane investigations. Although Animal Care & Control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly. Many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the City has with a local animal shelter. Due to the wooded mountainous geography of our City, residents share common areas with a host of wildlife (skunks, raccoons, ground hogs, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, etc.) Learn more about how to share space with wildlife by visiting our Living with Wild Life page . The City offers 24 hour service. The Animal Care & Control office hours are Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Please visit our Contact Us page. Operations continue from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. Saturdays and Sundays operations are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m, and on holidays, from 8 am to 4 pm. All \"after hour\" operations are for any emergency that a resident may have. Call the after-hours number at 412-255-2935. Responsible pet owners need to know that along with the obligation to properly feed, shelter, and care for a pet, there are laws (ordinances) to protect the animal, the pet owner, and the community. \"Owner\" includes every person who keeps or shelters and every person who allows an animal to be on their property (land or house) which is occupied by him or her. This means that if you are in possession of an animal, whether you own it or not - you\\'re responsible for its care, behavior, and welfare.

       "  'content': 'Toggle navigation Points Places Parcels Data: Points About Tweet Locations are not exact. (See ’About’ for details.) to Enable Heat Map 311 Requests Police Blotter Arrests Non-Traffic Citations Fire Incidents Code Violations Capital Projects Right of Way Permits Traffic Collisions Collision Time (24-hour clock) 0 24 0 24 0 — 24 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 Basemap OSM Mapnik OSM Mapnik Filter by Area Select Layer: 311 Requests 311 Requests At first glance, Burgh’s Eye View might seem like some\\xadthing from the dreams of our most “neb\\xadby” neigh\\xadbors. For the first time, you can easi\\xadly see all kinds of data about Pitts\\xadburgh—includ\\xading 311 re\\xadquests, build\\xading permits, code violat\\xadions, pub\\xadlic safe\\xadty in\\xadci\\xaddents, city assets, and public records on every par\\xadcel in the city. But City data isn’t a log of when and where we put our park\\xading chairs. It’s a huge col\\xadlect\\xadion of in\\xadform\\xadation about the world a\\xadround us that can help us under\\xadstand what’s happen\\xading in our neigh\\xadbor\\xadhoods, and lead us to ideas and decis\\xadions that can make where we live bet\\xadter. We think of it as neb\\xadby for the great\\xader good. So, whether you’re look\\xading at in\\xadform\\xadat\\xadion about side\\xadwalks that need re\\xadpair\\xading, or map\\xadping out street\\xadlights that are a lit\\xadtle too dim, re\\xadmem\\xadber: While data can help us know, its high\\xadest pur\\xadpose is to help us join to\\xadget\\xadher with other re\\xadsid\\xadents and the City to make change. Ok, so how do I use it? Burgh’s Eye View uses maps to visualize data generated by the City of Pittsburgh and its residents. As you play with it—changing the date range, for example—what you see on the map will change. You can scroll to zoom or use the +/- buttons at the top left, click on pins to see details, and move the map around using a mouse or touch. Currently, three general map types are available: maps of points, places and parcels. Points The points map shows data located at specific points in the city, such as public safety incidents, 311 requests, code violations, capital projects, and city assets. Search You can search for a specific address or block, as well as other keywords in some of the data. But keep in mind that a lot of location information is generalized to the block or neighborhood level in order to protect people\\'s privacy. Some sensitive datasets don\\'t have addresses at all, and so will not react to address searches. Dates Most information on the Points map has a date attached to it. Change the date range to see things from a certain day, week, month, or any period you’re interested in. Data Using these checkboxes, you can turn off datasets to get a clearer view of what you\\'re interested in. Some datasets have specific filters just for them. You can set those filters in the fields below each checkbox. 311 Requests This layer allows you to see 311 requests , which are non-emergency concerns or questions that residents send to the City using the 311 call center, social media , text message, the website , or the myBurgh apps for iOS or Android . As you can imagine, residents have a wide range of concerns and questions. Start typing in the “Request Type” box to select the types of requests you want to see on the map. You can also view requests that are assigned to specific City departments or agencies, and view requests by origin (whether they were submitted as a call, on social media, etc). Click any of the orange icons on the map to learn more about a specific 311 request Public Safety Information These layers allow you to see incidents captured in the 30-day police blotter , the police blotter archive as well as non-identifying information on arrests and non-traffic citations . Use the Hierarchy field to find specific types of crimes. Click on any of the blue, red, or pink icons on the map to learn more about a specific public safety incident. Building Information These layers allow you to see information on violations and city facilities . Select or start typing in the “Violation,” “Inspection Result,” “Next Action,” or “Facility Usage” fields to narrow down or view specific results. Click on any of the blue, green, or gray icons on the map to learn more about a specific permit, violation, or facility. \"Filter by Area\" Are you interested in looking at information for a particular neighborhood, Council district, Police zone, or Public Works division? Select the type of area you want to see—the default is Neighborhood—and then you can set the specific area or areas below that. As with Search, some datasets\\' locations are generalized and may not react to these filters. Also, if you like videos, check out these how-tos produced by our Cable Channel: Introduction and Overview Use Case: Public Safety Downloading Data Places The Places map allows you to view a wide range of City assets, including bridges and recreation space, steps, pools, historic districts, flood zones, traffic signals, and more. Search You can search for data in a specific neighborhood, as well as other keywords in some of the data. Data Using these checkboxes, you can turn off datasets to get a clearer view of what you\\'re interested in. Some datasets have specific filters just for them. You can set those filters in the fields below each checkbox. Traffic Signals The traffic signals section includes some terms that may be new to our users. “Actuated” means that the timing of a signal is determined by the number of vehicles detected at an intersection. “Actuated ped” means that the pedestrian button must be pushed to activate the signal timing for pedestrians; “fixed per” means that a pedestrian button does not need to be pushed. “Fully actuated” means that the signals are controlled by sensors, cameras, or radar. Parcels The Parcels map allows you to view, at the neighborhood level, delinquent properties, City-owned properties, and properties in a tax abatement program. You can also view information about any specific parcel, including type of owner, property class, sale information, county land value, and potential liens. Some information, including the owner’s name, is not included in order to protect people\\'s privacy. While data on properties that are tax delinquent, in a tax abatement program, or city-owned comes from the City of Pittsburgh, all other data on the Parcels maps comes our partners at Allegheny County. \"Filter by Neighborhood\" Are you interested in looking at information for a particular neighborhood? Select the neighborhood you want to see—the default is the Central Business District. Search You can search for specific parcels in the chosen neighborhood by entering in the parcel\\'s ID. However, the search feature also allows you to search for things like address, owner code, and use code. Individual Parcels Once you’ve selected the neighborhood you’d like to see, or entered the Parcel ID, you can click on any of the parcels to see information about that property. Wait, why are things where they are? Markers or “pins” for each dataset show up on the map differently depending on the source. Public Safety pins are geocoded by the block or intersection of the incident or arrest using Allegheny County\\'s geocoder, every night. Code violations are geocoded at the center of their respective parcel, which is determined by Allegheny County. 311 Requests are first geocoded by the City\\'s 311 request tracking system. To maintain citizens\\' privacy these requests are then specially obfuscated. This process is handled by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center , and they describe it this way: For some less-sensitive request types, actual coordinates appear in the 311 open data. For more sensitive requests, coordinates representing the approximate location of the complaint are shared to protect the identity of the person making the complaint. The data file indicates whether exact or approximate coordinates have been included. Wow, is there more like this? Whenever possible, Burgh’s Eye View will point you to other resources for the data or information you are viewing. This includes links to the Allegheny County Real Estate Portal , the 311 Request Online Form , and the City Online Facility Rental page. All of these resources are available 24/7, just like Burgh’s Eye View. This page has lots of links to other City data, information and resources, and you can find more at pittsburghpa.gov or by following the city on Twitter and Facebook . And yes there are more projects like this to come! You can write to the team that built this at analytics@pittsburghpa.gov . We\\'d love to hear your feedback, ideas, and hopes for the future of data in the City of Pittsburgh. (But please note that we may not be able to respond individually.) Burgh’s Eye View is an initiative of the Department of the Innovation & Performance ’s Analytics & Strategy Team. We work under the vision and leadership of Mayor Bill Peduto, who has from day one been committed to being transparent and open with City data.'},\n",

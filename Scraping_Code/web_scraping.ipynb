It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania , after Philadelphia , and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census . The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River , which combine to form the Ohio River . [ 7 ] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia , the second-largest in Pennsylvania , and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia . Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry . [ 8 ] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest , as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British Empires, Virginians , Whiskey Rebels , and Civil War raiders . [ 9 ] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. [ 10 ] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city. [ 11 ] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Allegheny Health Network , and 68 colleges and universities , including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh . [ 14 ] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense , software engineering , robotics , energy research , and the nuclear navy . [ 15 ] In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Other corporations that have regional headquarters and offices have helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth. [ 16 ] Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges . [ 8 ] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy , Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium , Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens , the National Aviary , and a diverse cultural district . [ 17 ] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers , Pittsburgh Penguins , and Pittsburgh Pirates . Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit . Etymology [ edit ] Main article: Name of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes , in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham . As Forbes was a Scotsman , he probably pronounced the name / ˈ p ɪ t s b ər ə / PITS -bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh ). [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act: [ 20 ] \"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\" [ 21 ] From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations. [ 22 ] [ 18 ] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed. [ 18 ] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921. [ 23 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Pittsburgh For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh . Historical claims Kingdom of France 1690s–1763 Great Britain 1681–1781 United States 1776–present Native Americans [ edit ] The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans . [ 24 ] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan , the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island , in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood. [ 25 ] : 289 18th century [ edit ] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution Fort Pitt Block House , built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh. The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River . [ 26 ] [ better source needed ] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements. [ 27 ] In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers. [ 27 ] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War , the North American front of the Seven Years' War , began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne. [ 28 ] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field . General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt , named after William Pitt the Elder , while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\". [ 29 ] During Pontiac's War , a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run . Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy , based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois . A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\". [ 34 ] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk. [ 37 ] Following the American Revolution , the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country . In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes . Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory . 19th century [ edit ] Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857 Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874) Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877 The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition . [ 38 ] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River . [ 39 ] The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising . By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine . By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany . Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom. [ 40 ] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad. [ 41 ] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act , as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada. [ 40 ] The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania , which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company . He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century [ edit ] An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902 [ 42 ] Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906 In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel . By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city , accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk , concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia . [ 43 ] The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936. The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population. [ 44 ] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century. [ 45 ] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers. [ 46 ] During World War II , demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort. [ 29 ] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\" [ 47 ] [ 48 ] was being overshadowed by James Parton 's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\" [ 49 ] Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures. [ 11 ] In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century [ edit ] During the late 2000s recession , Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values. [ 50 ] In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh. [ 51 ] Geography [ edit ] See also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km 2 ), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km 2 ) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km 2 ), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. The city is on the Allegheny Plateau , within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau . [ 52 ] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River . The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh , Carnegie Mellon University , Chatham University , Carnegie Museum and Library , and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential. Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features. [ a ] The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks. [ 53 ] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers. [ 54 ] Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail. Cityscape [ edit ] Areas [ edit ] See also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods , List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh , List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations , and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle, [ 55 ] and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods). [ 56 ] Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. Golden Triangle [ edit ] Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m). [ 57 ] The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River . This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority 's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south. [ 58 ] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown . North Side [ edit ] Further information: North Side (Pittsburgh) Townhouses in the Mexican War Streets neighborhood The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. The area was once known as Allegheny City and operated as its own independent city until 1907, when it was merged with Pittsburgh despite great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium , PNC Park , Kamin Science Center , National Aviary , Andy Warhol Museum , Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh , Randyland , Penn Brewery , Allegheny Observatory , and Allegheny General Hospital . [ 59 ] South Side [ edit ] Further information: South Side (Pittsburgh) East Carson Street in the South Side Flats The South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Starting in the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation , encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years leading up to 2014. [ 60 ] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues. In 1993, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development that included a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers . Construction of the development began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters . [ 61 ] East End [ edit ] Shadyside neighborhood The East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh , Carnegie Mellon University , Carlow University , Chatham University , The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History , Phipps Conservatory , and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall . It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park , Westinghouse Park , Schenley Park , Frick Park , The Frick Pittsburgh , Bakery Square , and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues. [ 62 ] Oakland , heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center . The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs. [ 63 ] Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze , Regent Square , Highland Park , Homewood , Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar , Larimer , East Hills , East Liberty , Polish Hill , Hazelwood , Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights. West End [ edit ] Further information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region The West End includes Mt. Washington , with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott . Ethnicities [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area , a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau . Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission , and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\" [ 66 ] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\", [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a. [ 74 ] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%. [ 75 ] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year, [ 76 ] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year. [ 76 ] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901. [ 76 ] [ b ] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995. [ 76 ] Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018. [ 77 ] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51. [ 78 ] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy. [ 79 ] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).

The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog. [ 83 ] According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an “80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023. [ 86 ] A past 2019 \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three. [ 87 ] In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works , the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey. [ 90 ] The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia. [ 91 ] Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999. [ 92 ] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\" [ 93 ] As of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance. [ 94 ] Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average. [ 95 ] The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. [ 95 ] Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh. [ 95 ] The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities. [ 95 ] This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism. [ 96 ] Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh. [ 97 ] WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education. [ 97 ] In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities. [ 98 ] Water quality [ edit ] The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits. [ 99 ] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959. [ 100 ] Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water. [ 101 ] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers. [ 102 ] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations. [ 103 ] The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority , or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions. [ 104 ] In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement. [ 107 ] In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority. [ 108 ] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). [ 107 ] PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water. [ 109 ] Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels. [ 110 ] In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties. [ 111 ] By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality. [ 111 ] Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014, [ 110 ] from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection. [ 112 ] Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water. [ 112 ] In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water. [ 112 ] Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit. [ 110 ] In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia. [ 111 ] In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water. [ 113 ] Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. [ 113 ] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead. [ 113 ] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system. [ 114 ] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. [ 114 ] Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.

Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010, [ 119 ] compared to 78.7% in 1970. [ 120 ] By the 2020 census , the population slightly declined further to 302,971. [ 118 ] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation, [ 126 ] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census. [ 127 ] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States. [ 128 ] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country. Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. [ 129 ] According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area. [ 129 ] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200. [ 130 ] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell ; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center . [ 131 ] [ 132 ] According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant , and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population.

The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.

[ 140 ] Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are from China , India , Korea and Italy . [ 141 ] Demographic changes [ edit ] Since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment. Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena. [ 13 ] This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961. [ 13 ] The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns. An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950. [ 13 ] Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now. [ 142 ] These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena. [ 13 ] In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes. [ 143 ] Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.” [ 143 ] The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place. [ 142 ] Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification. [ 144 ] Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place. [ 145 ] Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Pittsburgh See also: List of corporations in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.

This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh. [ 250 ] Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories “police budget cost per person,” “fines / forefeitures,” “Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),” “Force Used per Arrest,” “Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,” “Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,” “Discrimination Complaints Upheld,” “Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,” “Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,” and “Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.” This is 10 out of 15 categories.

[ 304 ] Expressways and highways [ edit ] Expressways Other Highways Parkway North US 19 PA 88 Parkway East & West Truck US 19 PA 121 Crosstown PA 8 PA 130 Allegheny Valley Expressway PA 50 PA 380 Ohio River Boulevard PA 51 PA 837 PA 60 PA 885 I-279 Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 ( Pennsylvania Turnpike ) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79 , the Pittsburgh International Airport , the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80 . The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena . The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70 , 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway , Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region. Airports [ edit ] Main article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports Pittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area . Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh. Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh). Intercity passenger rail and bus [ edit ] Main articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center Amtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station , via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City. Megabus , Greyhound Lines , and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia , New York City , and Washington, D.C. [ 305 ] Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station , Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station , Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station. Regional mass transit [ edit ] Main articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit Steel Plaza subway station Pittsburgh Regional Transit , formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States. [ 306 ] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems. [ 307 ] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust, [ 308 ] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares. The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter . These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport , Monroeville , McCandless , and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania . Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library , taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon , Mt. Lebanon , and Beechview , and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook . Freight rail [ edit ] Union Station , built in 1903 Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works , which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse 's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway 's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line , and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard , built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX , the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh. Port [ edit ] The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade. [ 309 ] Notable people [ edit ] Main article: List of people from Pittsburgh Sister cities [ edit ] Pittsburgh's sister cities are: [ 310 ] Bilbao , Spain Da Nang , Vietnam Fernando de la Mora , Paraguay Gaziantep , Turkey Glasgow , Scotland Karmiel , Israel Matanzas , Cuba Misgav , Israel Naucalpan , Mexico Ostrava , Czech Republic Prešov , Slovakia Saarbrücken , Germany Saitama , Japan San Isidro , Nicaragua Sheffield , England [ g ] Skopje , North Macedonia Sofia , Bulgaria Wuhan , China Zagreb , Croatia See also [ edit ] Pennsylvania portal Cities portal Greater Pittsburgh Region List of fiction set in Pittsburgh List of municipalities in Pennsylvania List of people from Pittsburgh Explanatory notes [ edit ] ^ The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights , Bluff , Brighton Heights , Crafton Heights , Duquesne Heights , East Hills , Fineview , Highland Park , Middle Hill , Mount Oliver , Mount Washington , Northview Heights , Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill , Ridgemont , South Side Slopes , Spring Hill-City View , Squirrel Hill , Stanton Heights , Summer Hill , Troy Hill , and Upper Hill . ^ The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980. [ 76 ] ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. ^ Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown , at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

      "Pittsburgh ( PITS-burg) is a city in and the county seat of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania, after Philadelphia, and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River. It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia. \n",
      "Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry. It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British Empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders. For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city. However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.\n",
      "Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network, and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy. In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Other corporations that have regional headquarters and offices have helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth. \n",
      "Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges. Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district. The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.\n",

      "== Etymology ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name  PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).\n",
      "Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\n",
      "\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"\n",
      "From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations. After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed. The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.\n",

      "=== Native Americans ===\n",
      "The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans. Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.: 289 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 18th century ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River. European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.\n",
      "In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers. During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne. The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\n",
      "During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\n",
      "During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\". Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.\n",
      "On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township. William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\n",
      "Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 19th century ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.\n",
      "The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n",
      "In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.\n",
      "Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom. The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad. Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\n",
      "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 20th century ===\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\n",
      "The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.\n",
      "The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.\n",
      "The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population. Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century. Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\n",
      "During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort. This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\" was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\n",
      "Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\n",
      "In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n",

      "=== 21st century ===\n",
      "During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\n",

      "== Geography ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.\n",
      "The city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau. The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.\n",
      "Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.\n",
      "The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks. Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.\n",
      "Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\n",

      "\n",
      "==== Areas ====\n",
      "\n",
      "The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle, and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods). Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== Golden Triangle =====\n",
      "Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m). The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south. It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== North Side =====\n",
      "\n",
      "The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. The area was once known as Allegheny City and operated as its own independent city until 1907, when it was merged with Pittsburgh despite great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, Kamin Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Penn Brewery, Allegheny Observatory, and Allegheny General Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== South Side =====\n",
      "\n",
      "The South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Starting in the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years leading up to 2014.  East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.\n",
      "In 1993, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development that included a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction of the development began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.\n",

      "===== East End =====\n",
      "\n",
      "The East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues. Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs. Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze, Regent Square, Highland Park, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, East Liberty, Polish Hill, Hazelwood, Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights.\n",

      "Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n",
      "Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\" In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\", recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Climate ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S. The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a. The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.\n",
      "The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year, a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year. Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901. Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.\n",
      "Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018. On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51. There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy. In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).\n",

      "==== Air quality ====\n",
      "The American Lung Association's (ALA) 2023 “State of the Air” report (which included data from 2019 to 2021) showed air quality in Pittsburgh improving. The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog.\n",
      "According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time. Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an “80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023.\n",
      "A past 2019 \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.\n",
      "In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas. The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey. The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.\n",
      "Although the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999. ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\"\n",
      "As of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.\n",
      "Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average. The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh. The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities. This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.\n",
      "Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh. WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education. In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Water quality ====\n",
      "The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits. This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959. Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water. As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers. Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations. The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions. In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.\n",
      "Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement. In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority. Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).\n",
      "PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water. Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels. In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties. By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality. Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014, from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection. Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.\n",
      "In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water. Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit. In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia. In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water. Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.\n",
      "There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system. Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.\n",

      "=== Demographic changes ===\n",
      "Since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment.\n",
      "Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena. This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961. The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns. An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950. Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now. These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.\n",
      "In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.\n",
      "Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”\n",
      "The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place. Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification. Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.\n",

Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".

It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party, as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party.

There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim. This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic. This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million. About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.\n",

Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.\n",

      "Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.\n",
      "Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh.\n",

       "  'content': '  Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.  1 of 2William C. Wall: View of the Great Fire of PittsburghView of the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, oil on canvas by William C. Wall, 1846; in the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pa. 51 × 81 cm.(more)2 of 2Pittsburgh: steel mill, 1886Bessemer converters in operation at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, 1886.(more)  Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.   After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881.  map of Pittsburgh, c. 1900Map of Pittsburgh (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.(more)  By 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power.'},\n",

       "  'content': '  By the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.

Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).  Carnegie Library of PittsburghCarnegie Library of Pittsburgh in 1901.(more) \\n  Central to the city’s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performs at Heinz Hall, a restored movie theatre.   Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses. The city’s zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two new sports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle: PNC Park is home of the Pirates, the city’s professional baseball team, and Acrisure Stadium houses the Steelers, its professional football team. The Penguins, Pittsburgh’s professional ice hockey team, plays at PPG Paints Arena. Popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on Pittsburgh’s waterways and Kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in West Mifflin.'}]"

Newspaper  reporters,  photographers,  radio  announcers,  inspectors  and \\npersons  of similar  vocation  who are admitted  free to any place  for the \\nperformance  of special  duties  in connection  with an event  and whose  special  \\nduties  are the sole reason  for their presence  and given  free admission,  are \\nnot liable  for any tax on admission.  Free admissions  granted  to such  persons  \\nwho are not admitted  solely  for the purpose  of performing their  special  duties  \\nin connection  with the event  are subject  to the tax equivalent  to the tax \\non the admission  charge  paid by other  persons  for the same or similar  \\naccommodations.  \\n  13  3.

(Ord.  38-1991,  eff. 11-25-91).  \\n \\ng. When  the City of Pittsburgh’s  Amusement  Tax is included  in the total collections \\nfrom patrons , the formula  for the Amusement  Tax is: \\n \\nA = Amusement  Tax  15   \\nA = .05 tax rate \\n1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate \\n \\nA = .05 tax rate \\n1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate \\n \\nA = .04762  \\n \\n \\nThe Amusement Tax is deemed included in the Established Price charged the patron if the \\nProducer does not  separately state the Amusement Tax on any ticket or receipt as required \\nby Section 303 , or if no receipt or ticket is issued to the patron.    \\n \\nEXAMPLE  \\nA = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total  \\n1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate \\n \\nA = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total  \\n1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate \\n \\nA = .04762  X $20.00  Total  \\n \\nA = $ .95  \\n \\nEXAMPLE  \\nTotal  admission  charge  is $20.00  x .04762  = $ .95 tax or \\n$19.05  – Admission  Charge  \\n$ .95 tax = 5% of admission  charge  before  taxes  \\n$20.00  – Total  (Admission  Charge  + Amusement  Tax) \\n \\nSECTION  302 – RECORDS  \\n \\nIn general  each  place  of amusement  must  maintain  complete  and accurate  records  of all \\ntransactions,  the total amount  of consideration  received  from all transactions  and the total \\namount  of tax collected  on the basis  of such  considerations.  Records  to be kept must  \\nconsist  of, but are not limited  to a monthly  summary  showing  the starting  and ending  \\nticket  numbers  for each  series,  the number  of tickets  sold at each  representative  price  and \\nthe amount  of tax collected.  \\n \\nWhere  an amusement  is included  in the price  of food and drink  the place  of amusement  \\nshall total the amount  of sales,  on the cash  register,  prior to the amusement.  The place  of \\namusement  shall begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the place  of \\namusement  ends.  If the place  of amusement  does  not do this it will pay on the 24 hour \\nperiod  of the day that the amusement  occurred.  Once  the total sales  have  been  \\ncalculated  from the place  of amusement,  the admission  charge  equals  the amount  paid for \\nfood and drink  times  ten percent.  The imputed  Amusement  Tax equals  the admission  \\ncharge  times  five percent.  \\n  16  The amount paid for food and drink  x 10% = THE ADMISSION  CHARGE  \\n \\nThe admission  charge  x 5% = THE IMPUTED  AMUSEMENT  TAX \\n \\nRecords  to be kept shall include  part of each  serial  numbered  ticket  used  at each  place  of \\namusement  issued  to each  patron  and copies  of all leases  or contracts  or agreements  \\nsupporting  the transactions  for permanent  use of boxes  or seats  in any place  of \\namusement.  \\n \\nSECTION  303 - TICKET  LABELING  \\n \\na.

The sum total of the established  price  and the tax. \\n \\nFAILURE  TO COMPLY  – in the event  that a Producer  fails to comply  with the ticketing  \\nand labeling  provisions  of Section  241.07(a)  the Producer  shall be subject  to the \\nsuspension  and/or  revocation  of his amusement  permit  pursuant  to section  241.03(c)  of \\nthe Pittsburgh Code. (Ord. 34-1994,  eff. 12-30-94).  The failure to comply with the ticketing \\nand labeling provisions will not excuse the Producer  from timely remitt ing the deemed \\ncollected Amusement Tax.  \\n \\nSECTION  304 – AMUSEMENT  TAX QUESTIONS  AND  ANSWERS  \\nQ. – Are admissions  to a movie  theater  not taxed if provided by an  Institution  of Purely  \\nPublic  Charity?  Is a movie theater  considered  a Performing  Art? \\nA. – No.  Admissions to a movie theater are not considered a Performing Art because it is \\nnot a live performance , and nor would they be considered an Exempt Performing Arts \\nProduction .  \\n \\nQ. – Does  a Producer of home  builders’  show s, trade shows,  or similar exhibitions  have  to \\ncollect the Amusement  Tax?  \\nA. – The admission  receipts  from a home  builders’  show  are properly  subject  to the \\nAmusement  Tax. The Amusement  Tax Chapter  241 of the Pittsburgh  Code  extends,  by  17  definition  to trade  shows  and similar  exhibitions.  \\n \\nQ. – Does  a Producer of wine tasting, beer tasting, whisky tasting, food tasting or similar \\nevents have  to collect the Amusement  Tax?  \\nA. – The admission  receipts  from a tasting event are properly  subject  to the Amusement  \\nTax, if the event is primarily intended to showcase a commercial product  or products , even \\nif no live entertainment or recreation is provided.  However, if the Producer does not provide \\nentertainment or recreation, but does collect sales taxes or drin k taxes, based on the \\nadmission charge or contribution, from the patron, then the event is an Exempt Amusement.    \\nA tasting event is not an Exempt Amusement even if historical or educ ational material is \\nprovided to the patron if such historical or educational material is not the primary purpose \\nof the event.  \\n \\nQ. – A bar with entertainment  has a cover  charge  of $10.00  with the Amusement  Tax \\nincluded.  How much  is the Amusement  Tax?  \\nA. - $10.00  cover  charge  X .04762  = $0.48 Amusement  Tax. \\nQ. – A bar with entertainment  has no cover  charge,  is any Amusement  Tax owed?  If so, \\nhow is it calculated?  \\nA. – The Amusement  Tax is owed.  The cover  charge  shall be imputed  per the City Code.  \\nThe amount  paid for admission  to the amusement  shall be ten (10%)  percent  of the \\namount  paid for refreshment,  service  and merchandise.  (The food and drink  for a bar). \\nThe place  of amusement  must  begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the \\nplace  of amusement  ends.  Once  you have  the total sales  from the place  of amusement  \\nyou are ready  to impute  the admission  charge.  \\nThe amount  paid for food and drink  X 10% = the admission  charge.  The admission  charge  \\nX 5% = the imputed  amusement tax.  \\nAn imputed  admission  charge  is implied,  and the tax will be collected.  An implied  charge  \\nis one that the place  of amusement  would  normally  collect.  The admission  charge  is \\ntherefore  imputed  and the tax paid by the place  of amusement.  \\n \\n  18  ARTICLE  IV \\nADMINISTRATION  AND  \\nENFORCEMENT  \\nSECTION  401 – POWERS  AND  DUTIES  OF TREASURER  (DIRECTOR)  \\n \\na. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer  to collect  and receive  the taxes,  fines,  and \\npenalties  imposed  by the City Code,  Title Two,  Article  VII, Chapter  241. It shall also \\nbe the duty of the Treasurer  to keep  a record  showing  the date of such  receipt.  \\n \\nb. The Treasurer  is charged  with the administration  and enforcement  of the provisions  \\nof the City Code,  and is empowered  to prescribe,  adopt,  promulgate  and enforce  \\nrules  and regulations  relating  to any matter  pertaining  to the administration  and \\nenforcement  of the City Code,  including  provisions  for the reexamination  and \\ncorrections  of declarations  and returns,  and of payments  alleged  or found  to be \\nincorrect,  or as to which  an overpayment  is claimed  or found  to have  occurred,  and \\nto prescribe  forms  necessary  for the administration  of the City Code.  \\n \\nc. The Treasurer  is authorized  to issue a ruling  upon  written  request  of a taxpayer  or \\nProducer . \\n \\nSECTION  402 – EXAMINATION  OF BOOKS  AND  RECORDS  OF PRODUCERS  \\n \\na. Agents  designated  by the Treasurer  are hereby  authorized  to examine  the books, \\npapers  and records  of any Producer  or supposed  Producer , in order  to verify  the \\naccuracy  of any declaration  or return,  or if no declaration  or return  was filed,  to \\nascertain  the tax due. Every  Producer  or supposed  Producer , is hereby  directed  and \\nrequired  to give to the Treasurer,  or to any agent  designated  by him/her,  the means,  \\nfacilities  and opportunity  for such  examinations  and investigations,  as are hereby  \\nauthorized.  \\n \\nb. If records  are not available  in the City of Pittsburgh  to support the returns which were  \\nfiled or which  should  have  been  filed,  the Producer  will be required  to make  them  \\navailable  to the Treasurer  either  by producing  them  in a City of Pittsburgh  location  or \\nby paying  for the expenses  incurred  by the Treasurer  in traveling  to the place  where  \\nthe records  are regularly  kept.  \\n \\nc. Any information  gained  by the Treasurer,  by designated  agents,  or by any other  \\nofficial  or agent  of the City of Pittsburgh,  as a result  of any declarations,  returns,  \\ninvestigations,  hearings  or verifications  required  or authorized  by the City Code,  \\nshall be confidential  except  for official  purposes  and shall not be released  except  in \\naccordance  with a proper  judicial  order,  or as otherwise  provided  by law. \\n \\nSECTION  403 – RECORDS  TO BE KEPT  BY THE PRODUCER  \\n \\nProducers  who collect  the Amusement  Tax are required  to keep  such  records  as will enable  \\nthe filing of true and accurate  returns  of the tax and such  records  shall be preserved  for a \\nperiod  of not less than three (3)  years  from the filing date or due date whichever  is later in \\norder  to enable  the Treasurer  or any agent  designated  by him/her  to verify  the correctness   19  of the declarations  or returns  filed. \\n \\nSECTION  404 – AUDITS  \\n \\nIf, as a result  of an examination  conducted by the Treasurer, a return  is found  to be incorrect,  \\nthe Treasurer  is authorized  to assess  and collect  any underpayments  of the Amusement  \\nTax.  If no return  has been  filed and a tax is found  to be due, the tax actually  due may be \\nassessed  and collected  with or without  the formality  of obtaining  a return  from the producer .  \\nDeficiency  assessments  (i.e., where  producer  has filed a return  but is found  to owe \\nadditional  tax) shall include  taxes  for up to three (3) years  prior to the date when  the \\ndeficiency  is assessed.  Where no return  was filed,  there  shall be no limit to the period  of \\nassessment.  \\n \\n  20  ARTICLE  V \\nSUITS  FOR TAX COLLECTIONS, VIOLATIONS,  FINES, INTEREST & \\nPENALTIES  \\nSECTION  501 – REMEDIES  NOT MUTUALLY  EXCLUSIVE  \\n \\nThe remedies  provided  in Section  502 or Section  505 are not mutually  exclusive.   The \\nutilization  by the Treasurer  of one remedy  does  not preclude  utilization  of the other.  \\n \\nMoreover, use of either or both of the remedies  provided in  these  Sections  does  not \\npreclude  the use by the City of Pittsburgh  of any other  legal or administrative procedure  \\nwhich  can bring  about  compliance  by the Producer  with the provisions  of Chapter  241 of \\nthe Pittsburgh  Code  and these regulations.  \\n \\nOnce it has been determined that that a Producer  owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all \\nactions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional \\ninformation, auditing Producer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount \\nof the tax, or obtaining liens on the Producer ’s property, wage attachments, levies, and \\nseizures and sales of the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer \\nmay enter  into a written agreement with the Producer for payment of the tax in installments \\nif the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer \\nmay also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek cri minal \\ncharges in appropriate circumstances.   \\n \\nSECTION  502 – SUITS  FOR  RECOVERY  OF UNPAID  TAXES  \\n \\nThe Treasurer  may sue in the name of the City of  Pittsburgh, in law or in equity, for the  \\nrecovery  of those  taxes  due and unpaid  under  the provisions  of the Amusement  Tax, to \\ncompel  the production  of records  or to enforce  any other  provisions  of the law.  Such suits \\nmay also be brought against Responsible Persons.  \\n \\nSECTION  503 - LIMITATIONS  \\n \\na. The following  periods  of limitations  shall apply  to suits for collection  of taxes.  \\n \\n1. When  a return  has been  filed but no tax paid,  any suit brought  to recover  the tax \\ndue and unpaid  shall be filed within  three  (3) years  after the return  was due or \\nfiled,  whichever  is later.  Where  no return  was filed,  there  shall be no limit to file \\nsuit for the collection of taxes.  \\n \\n2. In the case  of a deficiency  assessment,  suit shall be filed within  three  (3) years  \\nafter the assessment has been made.  \\n \\nb. The limitations  set forth in paragraph  (a) shall not prevent  the institution  of a suit \\nfor the collection  of any tax due or determined  to be due in the following  cases:  \\n \\n1. When  no return  was filed,  there  is no limitation.  \\n \\n2. When  the return  is fraudulent,  there  is no limitation.  \\n  21  3. When  there  is an understatement  of tax liability  of twenty -five (25%)  or more,  and \\nnot due to fraud, suit must  be begun  within  six (6) years.  \\n \\nc. A return  filed before  the due date is deemed  to be filed on the due date.  \\n \\nSECTION  504 – PENALTY  AND  INTEREST  \\n \\na. Producers  must  collect  the tax imposed  herein  and shall be liable  to the City of \\nPittsburgh  for the payment  of the tax. If, however,  any Producer  shall fail to make  \\nany report  and payment  as herein  required  a penalty  at the rate of five (5%)  percent  \\nper month  for each  month  or a fraction  of a whole  month  on the amount  of tax and \\ninterest  of one (1%)  percent  per month  for each  month  or fraction  of a whole  month  \\nduring  the period  in which  the tax remains  unpaid  shall be added  to the tax.  In no \\nevent shall the interest rate assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the \\nMunicipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. 7143, or applicable law.  \\n \\nb. There  is no limit, or cut off point,  for applying penalty and interest  \\n \\nc. Penalty  and Interest  on Deficiency  Assessment.  \\n \\nd. On any additional  tax determined  to be due as a result  of a deficiency  assessment,  \\npenalty  and interest  will be assessed  from the day the tax should  have  been  paid to \\nthe date of payment.   Penalty  and interest  is calculated  as described  above  in the \\napplicable  portion  of Section  504 (a). \\n \\ne. Where  suit is brought  for the recovery  of such  tax, the person  liable  therefore  shall,  \\nin addition,  be liable  for the costs  of collection  and the interest  and penalties  herein  \\nimposed.  Once  due and owing,  penalty  and interest  become  part of the tax and \\nshall be collected  as such.  A person’s  belief  that no tax is due and owing,  or the \\nfailure  of any person  to receive  or obtain  the forms  required  for making  the returns  \\nrequired  under  the City Code  is not a valid defense  to the imposition  of penalties  \\nherein  for violation.   Good  faith shall not be a defense  to the imposition  of penalty.  \\n \\nSECTION  505 – FINES  AND  PENALTIES  FOR  VIOLATION  OF APPLICABLE  \\nPROVISIONS  OF TITLE  TWO,  PITTSBURGH  CODE  \\n \\na. Violations  – No person  shall:  \\n \\n1. Fail, neglect,  or refuse  to make  any declaration  or file a return  required  under  the \\nCity Code.  \\n2. Refuse  to permit  the Treasurer  or his/her  designee  to examine  the books,  records  \\nor accounts  of any business,  taxable  or otherwise,  to determine  liability.  \\n3. Make  any incomplete,  false  or fraudulent  return  or attempt  to do anything  to \\navoid  full disclosure  of the amount  of tax due to avoid  payment  in whole  or in \\npart, of the Amusement Tax.  \\n4. Divulge  information,  which  is confidential  under  Chapter  201.06  of the City Code.  \\n5. Fail to make  any payment  when  it is due.  22  b. In addition  to any other  penalties  or enforcement  proceedings  provided  for by \\nordinance  for the collection  and enforcement  of taxes:  \\n1. Any person  who willfully  fails or refuses  to appear  before  the Treasurer  or his/her  \\nagent  in person  with the employer’s  books,  records  or accounts  for examination  \\nwhen  required  under  the provisions  of Title Two of the City Code  to do so, or who \\nwillfully  refuses  to permit  inspection  of the books,  records  or accounts  of any \\namusement  in the person’s  custody  or control  when  the right to make  such  \\ninspection  by the Treasurer  or his/her  agent  is requested,  shall be guilty  of a \\nmisdemeanor  and shall,  upon  conviction,  be sentenced  to pay a fine of not more  \\nthan five hundred  dollars  ($500)  or to a term of imprisonment of not more than six  \\nmonths, or both.  \\n \\n2. The fines  and terms  of imprisonment,  imposed  under  this Section  shall be in \\naddition  to any other  relief  granted  to the City of Pittsburgh  of a monetary  nature  \\nunder  the provisions  of this Article.  \\n \\n3. Each  and every  day that the violation  continues  shall constitute  a separate  offense  \\nfor which  a fine may be imposed.  \\n \\nSECTION  506 – PERSONAL LIABILITY OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS  \\n \\nBecause the Amusement Tax is collected from Patrons, the Amusement Tax is not the \\nproperty of the Producer but instead is held in trust for the benefit of the City.  Any \\nAmusement Tax collected from patrons or deemed included in the Established Price paid \\nby Patrons shall be considered trust fund taxes  held for the benefit of the City .  Should the \\nProducer fail to timely remit the Amusement Tax due to the City, the Treasurer may assess \\nand collect any unpaid Amusement Tax directly from any Responsible Person  or from the \\nProducer, or both .  A Responsible  Person can show he is not liable for any collected \\nAmusement Tax if he shows the Amusement T ax has been properly refunded to the Patron s \\nwho paid the tax .  If the Producer uses trust fund taxes to pay a lawful obligation of the \\nProducer, the payee of such  funds shall not be considered a Respo nsible Person, unless \\nthe payee acts in bad faith or has direct knowledge of the breach of trust.   \\n \\nIf there are multiple Responsible Persons for a Producer, each Responsible Person shall \\nhave joint and several liabili ty for the unremitted Amusement Tax.  However, in no event \\nmay the Treasurer collect more from the Responsible Persons and the Producer in total \\nthan the Producer owes the City.  \\n \\nOnly the Amusement Tax shall be considered a trust fund asset.  Penalties and  interest \\nassessed against the Provider, as opposed penalties and interest assessed against the \\nResponsible Person directly, shall not be consider trust funds monies.   \\n \\nIn an Article VI action, a  Responsible Person shall not be able to challenge the Amuse ment \\nTax calculation derived from an assessment against the Producer once that assessment \\nagainst the Producer has become final.   \\n  23  ARTICLE VI \\nPRODUCER, \\nTAXPAYER , AND \\nRESPONSIBLE \\nPERSON REMEDIES  \\nSECTION  601 – TREASURER  (DIRECTOR)  HEARINGS  \\nAny taxpayer , Producer, or Responsible Person  aggrieved by  an assessment  by the \\nTreasurer  shall,  within  ninety  (90) days  after the date of notice  of the assessment,  request  \\na Treasurer’s  Hearing  on a form obtained  from the Treasurer  for that purpose.  53 \\nPa.C.S. § 8431. The Treasurer  may on his/her  own initiative  cite a Producer or \\nResponsible Person  for a hearing.  \\n \\na. Any taxpayer , Producer or Responsible Person  who fails to request  a Treasurer’s  \\nHearing  within  a timely  manner,  waives  the right to contest  any element  of the \\nassessment,  and that party’s  failure  to challenge  the Treasurer’s  adjudication  will \\nbe construed  as an admission  by that party  as to the propriety  of the assessment.  \\n \\nb. The written petition for reassessment shall contain at minimum:  \\n \\n1. The petitioner’s name, address, and daytime telephone number.  \\n2. The petitioner’s account and/or social security number.  \\n3. A copy of the assessment notice the party  received from the Finance \\nDepartment.  \\n4. A detailed explanation consisting of the reason or reasons the petitioner \\ndisagrees with the assessment and any documentation necessary to support \\nthe petitioner ’s claims.  \\n5.

The Treasurer will issue its decision within 60 days of the receipt of the petitioner ’s \\ncomplete and accurate petition form . \\n \\n  24  SECTION  602 – APPEALS  \\nAny person  aggrieved  by the decision  of the Treasurer,  following  a hearing,  shall have  \\nthe right to make  an appeal  to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, in \\naccordance with the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights Act. 53 Pa.C.S. § 8434 .  Any appeal  must  \\nbe commenced  within  thirty  (30) days  of the date of the notice  of the Treasurer’s  \\ndecision.  If no such  appeal  is timely  filed,  the aggrieved  party  waives  his/her  right to \\ncontest  any element  of the Treasurer’s  adjudication,  and that party’s  failure  to challenge  \\nthe same  will be construed  as an admission  by that party  as to the propriety  of the \\nTreasurer’s  decision.  No hearing  or appeal  will operate  to suspend  the accrual  of penalty  \\nand interest  from the date the tax was due to the date it is actually  paid.  \\n \\nSECTION  603 – PAYMENT  UNDER  PROTEST  \\nThe Treasurer  will accept  payments  of disputed  tax amounts  under  protest  pending  \\nappeals;  however,  any request  for refund  of such  monies  must  be filed in accordance  \\nwith Section  604. \\n \\nSECTION  604 – REFUNDS  \\na.

For amounts  paid as a result  of a notice  asserting  or informing  a Producer or \\nResponsible Person  of an underpayment, a written request fo r a refund  shall be filed \\nwith the Department  of Finance  within  one (1) year of the date of the payment.  \\nc. Patrons who believe that they are owed a refund  because they overpaid the \\nAmusement Tax , shall first approach the Producer for a refund because the Producer \\nhas the best knowledge of the facts surrounding the amusement.  The Producer shall \\nhave sixty days to review the refund request and grant or deny the refund in writing.  \\nIf a patron  still believes he is owed a refund , after the Producer has issued a written \\nrefusal,  he may file a written request for refund with the Department of Finance.  S uch \\nwritten request shall include the name and address of the patron, the name and \\naddress of the Producer , the date or dates of the amusement, a copy of any ticket or \\nreceipt  issued by the Producer , a short summary of the reasons why the patron \\nbelieves t he tax was overpaid, a copy of the written rejection from the Producer , a \\ncalculation of the overpaid Amusement Tax, and a calculation of the correct \\nAmusement Tax due and a calculation of the amount that should be refunded.

For the required terms \\nof any installment plan See, Second Class City Trea surer’s Sale and Collection Act, 53 P.S. \\n§ 27207 and Local Taxpayer Bill of Rights, 53 Pa.C.S. § 8436.  If the Producer or \\nResponsible Person fails to abide by the terms of the installment payment plan, the \\nTreasurer may demand immediate payment of tax, pe nalty , and interest.  \\n \\n \\n  26  ARTICLE  VII: \\nSAVINGS  AND SEVERABILITY AND DISCLOSURES  \\n \\nSECTION 701 – SAVINGS  CLAUSE  AND  SEVERABILITY . \\nIf a final decision  of a court  of competent  jurisdiction  holds  any provision  of these  \\nregulations,  or the application  of any provision  to any circumstances,  to be illegal  or \\nunconstitutional,  the other  provisions  in these  regulations,  or the application  of such  \\nprovision  to other circumstances,  shall remain in full force  and effect.  \\n \\nThe intent  of the Treasurer  is that the provisions  of these  regulations  shall be severable  \\nand that they would  have  been  adopted  if any such  illegal  or unconstitutional  provisions  \\nhad not been  included herein.  \\n \\nSECTION  702 – DISCLOSURE STATEMENT  \\nA copy  of the Taxpayer  Bill of Rights  can be requested  in writing  at the address  below  \\nor downloaded  at   \\nhttp://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/finance/10_taxpayers_bill_of_rights.pdf  \\n \\nTREASURER,  CITY  OF PITTSBURGH  AUDIT  SECTION  \\n414 GRANT  ST RM 206 \\nPITTSBURGH  PA 15219 -2476  \\n \\n \\n \\n '},\n",

For persons who perform services within and \\nwithout the City, Payroll Expense shall be apportioned in accordance with Section 102 of these \\nregulations.  \\nCHARITY – a charitable organization that qualifies for tax exempt ion pursuant to the act of \\nNovember 26, 1997 (P.L. 508, No 55), known as the “Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act” , \\n10 P.S. § 371, that provides the evidence required by 10 P.S. § 376(a).  \\nCITY – the area within the city limits of the City of Pittsbur gh. \\nCOMPENSATION – salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, net earnings and incentive \\npayments, whether based on profit or otherwise, fees, tips and any other form of remuneration \\nearned for services rendered, whether paid directly or through an agent, and whether in cash \\nor in property or the right to receive property , excluding any Passive Income  received by \\nPartners or Self -employed persons.    \\nThe Compensation of a Partner or Self -employed person is that person’s Taxable Distributions \\nfrom each separate B usiness carried on within the City.  \\n  \\nDISTRIBUTIONS – drawing account; the owner’s account for recording any withdrawals.  \\n  -4-  DRAWING ACCOUNT – a temporary capital account, set up in the name of a Partner  or Self -\\nemployed  person  from which the individual can withdraw money or other assets in anticipation \\nof profit  of the business.  \\nEMPLOYEE – any individual in the service of an Employer, under an appointment or contract \\nof hire or apprenticeship, express or implied, oral or writte n, whether lawfully or unlawfully \\nemployed.    \\nIndividuals who may be classified as an independent contractor under the tax reporting rules \\nassociated with IRS Form 1099 -MISC , can be re -classified as Employees for purposes of this \\ntax.  I rrespective of the common law tests for determining the existence of an independent \\ncontractor relationship, an individual performing work or service for Compensation shall be \\ndeemed to be an Employee of the person for whom the work or service is performed unless: \\n(1) such i ndividual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the \\nperformance of such work or service, under his/her appointment of contract of hire or \\napprenticeship; (2) such work or service is outside the usual course of the business of  the \\nperson for which such service is performed; or, (3) such individual is customarily engaged in \\nan independently established trade, occupation, business or profession.   A Partner or Self -\\nemployed person is not an Employee.  \\n \\nEMPLOYER – any person conduct ing Business within the City .  An Exempt Employer is not \\nan Employer under these regulations.   A Partnership is an Employer a s to its Employees and \\nas to any of its Partners providing service in the City.  A Partner, conducting one or more \\nbusiness es within the City through a Partnership , where the Partnership  does not file a Payroll \\nTax return with the City, is an Employer.   Any Self -Employed Person conducting one or more \\nBusiness within the City is an Employer.  \\n \\nAny person who is classified as an em ployer under the Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax \\nstatute is an Employer under these regulations. 72 P.S. § 7301 (h).  The term Employer \\nincludes any person that makes an election under 26 U.S.C. § 3504 to act as a payroll agent , \\nor any person who  both with holds and  remits the City local earned income tax, 53 P.S. § \\n6924.501 , or the City local services tax, 53 P.S. § 6924.301.1(9) (v), on behalf of another.   53 \\nP.S. § 6924.303(j).   To decide issues involving joint employers, the City will look to the \\nguidance  provided under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2 ( 85 FR 2820 , \\neffective March 16, 2020 ). \\n \\nFor example, a payroll reporting company that is not a common law employer of the workers \\nof another unless it is: (a) an employer of those workers under 72 P.S. § 7301(h) or (b) the \\njoint employer of th ose workers.  \\n \\nEXEMPT EMPLOYER  – any person that is a Governmental Entity .  A contractor or consultant , \\nclassified as a Partner , a Self -employed person,  or a person receiving Form 1099 -MISC,  \\nproviding services to an Exempt Employer is not itself exempt  merely because he or she \\nderives service revenue from a Governmental Entity . \\n \\nGUARANTEED PAYMENTS  – payments to Partners by the Partnership for services that are \\ndetermined without regard to th e net income of the Partnership.  For example, health insurance \\npremiums paid by the Partnership on behalf of any Partner are Guaranteed Payments because \\nthey are determined without regard to the net income of the Partnership.  \\n  -5-  GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY  – any ag ency, authority, department, or instrumentality of the \\nfederal government or of another State, and any unit of government listed under 1 01 Pa. Code \\n§ 23.221.  \\n \\nINTERNAL REVENUE CODE – the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public Law 99 - 514), as \\namended , 26 U.S.C. § 1, and following, as it was in effect on January 1, 20 20.  Any citation to \\nregulations issued under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 C.F.R. § 1, and following, \\nrefers to the regulations in effect on January 1, 20 20. \\n \\nNET DISTRIBUTION – the am ount of a Partner’s or Self -employed person’s draws from net \\nincome from one or more Business es that have activities in the City shall be reported for the \\nPayroll Expense Tax.   For purposes of this regulation,  TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS  are limited \\nby the sum of draws or net income for that Partner  or Self -employed person , whichever is less. \\nIf the Partner’s or Self -Employed person’s Net Distribution exceeds that individual ’s share of \\nnet profit s from a particular Business , the excess draw is a return of capita l. A return of capital \\nis not taxable because this is a liquidation of a Partner’s or Self-employed person’s assets by \\nthe owner .  A Partner’s Taxable Distribution s shall include a partner’s share of Guaranteed \\nPayments from the Partnership.   Taxable Distr ibutions shall be determined using the same tax \\naccounting method used to report taxable income for Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax \\npurposes, Tax Reform Code of 1971.   Taxable Distributions from a Business are presumed to \\nbe derived from the current year’ s net income of that Business.  \\n \\nPARTNER  – an individual owner or member in a Partnership.   A Partner will owe tax based \\non Taxable Distributions.  A Partner is not taxed on his or her Passive Income.  \\n \\nPARTNERSHIP – an unincorporated entity, joint venture, business trust, general partnership, \\nlimited partnership, limited liability company, syndicate, or any other unincorporated \\nassociation , with two or more owners that is taxed for Pennsylvania state income purposes as \\na pass -through entity.   Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7401 (definition of a “Corporation”).  \\nAn unincorporated entity , with one owner,  that is treated under the federal “check -the-box” as \\na disregarded entity is not a Partnership.  26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on \\nJanuary 1, 2 020).  See, Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7307.21.   An unincorporated entity, \\nwith one or more owners, that has made the federal “check -the-box” election to be taxed as a \\n“corporation” is not a Partnership but it may be an Employer.  \\n \\nPASSIVE INCOME  – Items of i ncome earned by a Partner or Self -employed person from \\ninterest  (not derived from working capital investments) , dividends, capital  gains  (except for an \\nindividual who is considered a trader and not an investor) , ground rents, royalties associated \\nwith the development of natural resources  through a non -operating interest , retirement income \\nearned after retirement, and real estate rental income where substantial services are not \\nprovided to tenants , is non-taxable Passive Income.  In determining whet her any portion of net \\nprofits from a Business may constitute Compensation or non -taxable Passive Income, the \\nTreasurer will follow the guidance issued under Tax Refo rm Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7303 (a), \\nand the PA Personal Income Tax Return Guide, except wh ere such guidance is inconsistent \\nwith the purposes of the Payroll Tax .  Income earned by a Partner  or by a Self -employed \\nperson , is not Passive Income if the business provides professional services (e.g. law, \\naccounting, architectural, professional engine ering, actuarial, or medical services) or personal \\nservices to customers, unless the Partner or Self -Employed person is retired , based on age or \\nyears of service,  and does not provide services to the business .  Guaranteed Payments made \\nto a Partner are not  Passive Income.   Payments made to a retiring Partner under Section 736 \\nof the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 736, are Passive Income.   The Passive Income  -6-  exclusion only applies to Partners and Self -employed persons, but not to Employees whose \\nCompensa tion is reported to the taxing authorities on a Form W -2 or Form 1099 -MISC.  \\n \\nPAYROLL EXPENSE – the total Compensation paid, including salaries, wages, net \\ndistributions, commissions, bonuses, stock options and other compensation to all individuals \\nwho duri ng any tax year, perform work or render services in whole or in part in the City of \\nPittsburgh. Employee contributions and deductions resulting from an employee election, \\nwhether deferred or otherwise, to qualified cash or deferred arrangements, such as an Internal \\nRevenue Code Section 401( k) retirement plan or Internal Revenue Code Section 125  \\n“cafeteria plan” , do not reduce total Compensation . Compensation meeting the definition of \\nearned income would be part of the Payroll Expense Tax  associated with a  particular \\nEmployee  who is not a Partner or a Self -employed person .  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § \\n6924.501 (“Earned Income”).  The Payroll Tax is on gross payroll  of the Employer .  The \\nEmployers’ portions of federal and state payroll taxes, health insu rance  premiums , retirement \\nplan contributions , etc., are not  part of taxable  gross payroll.    \\n \\nThe Payroll Expense of a Partner or Self -employed person is the cumulative annual  Taxable \\nDistributions associated with each separate Business  carried on w ithin the Ci ty rather than \\n“Earned Income” as defined in 53 P.S. § 6924.501.  \\n \\nPERSON – a corporation, Partnership, Partner, Self-employed individual, business trust, \\nassociation, unincorporated entity, estate, trust, foundation or natural person. Whenever used \\nin any provision prescribing a fine or penalty the word “person” as applied to Partnerships, \\nshall mean  the Partners thereof, and as applied to corporations and unincorporated \\nassociations, shall mean the officers thereof.   A Governmental Entity  is not a Pe rson.  \\n \\nSELF -EMPLOYED  – an individual  who earns  Compensation from one or more separate \\nBusiness es carried on within the City , other than as an Employee or as a Partner.  The single \\nmember owner of a n unincorporated entity that is treated as disregarded entity under the \\nfederal “check -the-box” regulations, 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on January 1, \\n2020), is treated as Self -Employed and not as a Partner.  The Compensation of a Self-\\nemploy ed individual shall be that person’s Taxable Distributions from each separate business \\nreported on Schedules C, E, or F of the Pennsylvania individual income tax Form PA -40, as \\nwell as any other non-employee Compensation , which is not otherwise reported on  Schedules \\nC, E, or F.  Passive Income  of a Self -employed person is not subject to the Payroll Tax .  If the \\nSelf-Employed person does not keep records of Taxable Distrib utions, the entire net income \\nof each separate Business  is presumed to be a Taxable Dis tribution.  Any individual who is \\nclassified as an Employee, because of the control exercised by the Employer, is not Self -\\nEmployed as to any Compensation associated with that particular Business.  \\n \\nTAX YEAR – a twelve -month period from January 1 to December 31.  \\n \\nTAXPAYER – a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity required \\nhereunder to file a return of payroll expense, or to pay a tax thereon.  An Employer , Partner,  or \\nSelf Employed person are a Taxpayer.   An Exempt Employer is not a Taxpayer.  \\n \\nTEMPORARY SEASONAL OR ITINERANT BUSINESS – shall mean an Employer whose \\npresence in the City is of a duration of one hundred twenty (120) days or less.  \\n \\nTREASURER – references to the Treasurer in these regulations refer to the Director and /or \\nthe Department of Finance. The Director holds principal responsibility for tax administration in \\nthe City of Pittsburgh. The Deputy Director of Finance serves as City Treasurer.   -7-   \\nSECTION 102 – WHO MUST FILE A RETURN  \\n \\na. The City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258, imposes a Payroll Tax on all persons \\nthat engage, hire, employ or contract with one or more individuals, as employees, to \\nperform work or render services within the City of Pittsburgh. The Payroll Tax is \\ncomputed on the employer’s payroll  expense .  The Payroll Tax on Partners and Self -\\nEmployed is computed based on Taxable Distributions  from any Business es. \\nb. One hundred percent of the payroll expense is attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for \\nEmployers whose employees perform work or render services exclusively in the City of \\nPittsburgh.  \\nc. One hundred percent of a Partner’s  or Self -employed person’s Taxable Distributions \\nare attributable to the City of Pittsburgh for person(s) who have net income from sales \\nor services rendered exclusive ly in the City of Pittsburgh.  \\nd. For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and \\npartly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense \\nattributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the perce ntage of the total number of \\nworking hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of \\nworking hours employed within and outside of the City of Pittsburgh for each individual \\nemployee.   Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303( a). \\ne. Employers who have payroll expense consisting of work done within and outside of the \\nboundaries of the City of Pittsburgh , but who do not regularly maintain records showing \\nhours worked so as to be able to use the apportionment method under subsection (d) \\nof this regulation,  may use a representative test period or conduct a survey based on \\nfactual data to arrive at a formula with which to calculate the percentage of payroll \\nexpense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh. Any formula so established will be subject \\nto review and correction by the City of Pittsburgh. A thorough description explaining the \\nformula shall be attached to the first return each year. The data supporting the formula \\nshall be maintained for at least three (3) years as a part of offi ce records for audit and \\nreview purposes.  \\nf. Partners and Self -Employed individuals who have Taxable Distributions generated from \\nintrastate sales or services partly within the City of Pittsburgh or partly outside the City \\nof Pittsburgh shall report on the  Taxable Distributions  associated with sales or services \\nrendered within the City of Pittsburgh. Where it is impractical to determine the exact \\nTaxable Distributions , an apportionment formula may be used. Any formula so \\nestablished will be subject to review a nd correction by the City of Pittsburgh Finance \\nDepartment. The data supporting the formula must be maintained as a part of office \\nrecords for audit and review purposes. A thorough description explaining the formula \\nshall be attached to the first return ea ch year. The data supporting the formula shall be \\nmaintained for at least three  (3) years as a part of office records for audit and review \\npurposes.  \\ng. Partners and Self -employed individuals who have Compensation from sources within \\nand without Pennsylvania , may apportion their Compensation to the City using the \\nformula used reporting personal income tax on Form PA -40, 61 Pa. Code § 109.5, by \\nsubstituting the  word  “City” for the “Commonwealth”  where necessary.   In making that \\ncalculation, a ll intrastate sale s and services within Pennsylvania are deemed allocated \\nto the City if the Partner ’s or Self -employed individual ’s sole office in Pennsylvania is  -8-  located in the City.  \\nh. An employer which conducts business in the City of Pittsburgh on a temporary, seasonal \\nor itinerant basis shall file a return and pay the tax within ten (10) days of the completion \\nof the temporary, seasonal, or itinerant business.  \\n \\n \\nARTICLE II  \\nIMPOSITION OF TAX  \\nSECTION 201 – LEVY AND RATE  \\nThe tax levied pursuant to the City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258 is know n as the \\nPayroll Tax. The rate of tax is fifty-five hundredths of a percent (.55% or .0055) of Payroll \\nExpense generated as a result of an employer conducting business within the City of \\nPittsburgh .  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(a) ; Local Tax Enabling Act. 53 P.S. § \\n6924.311(12) . \\nSECTION 202 – COMPUTATION OF TAX  \\na. The Payroll Tax is a tax that is levied on Employers . This tax is separate and distinct \\nfrom the earned income tax withheld from employees. Under no cir cumstance should \\nthe Payroll Tax be deducted from the employees’ compensation or benefits .  Local Tax \\nEnabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(f).  \\nb. The payroll amount apportioned to the City shall be determined as set forth in Section \\n102 of the Regulations.  \\nc. Tax Base – The tax shall be paid quarterly and the tax for each quarter shall be \\ncomputed on the Payroll  Expense of the current quarter attributable to the City of \\nPittsburgh.   The Tax Base for Partners and Self -Employed individuals is Taxable \\nDistribution s associated with each separate Business within the City.  \\nd. An employer which conducts Business in the City of Pittsburgh on a temporary, seasonal \\nor itinerant basis shall calculate the tax on the total compensation earned while in the \\nCity of Pittsburgh.  \\ne. Discontinuing Business – Every person who ceases to carry on a Business during any \\ntax quarter after having paid the Payroll Tax for the entire quarter shall, upon making \\nproper application on a form obtained from the Treasurer, be entitled to receive a \\nprorated refund of the tax paid based upon the period of time he was not in Business \\nduring the tax quarter. In the event that a person who discontinues Business during any \\ntax quarter does so before payment of the tax becomes due for such tax quarter, said \\nperson may apportion the tax and pay an amount to be computed by multiplying the \\nPayroll Expense for the preceding tax quarter by a fraction whose numerator shall be \\nthe number of days such person was in Business during the current tax quarter and \\nwhose deno minator shall be the total number of days in the current quarter. The final \\nreturn shall be due ten (10) days after the discontinuation of Business.   Self-employed \\nindividuals and Partners are considered to have discontinued their Business only if all \\nsepa rate Businesses of the individual are discontinued.  \\nf. A charitable organization, as defined above, shall calculate the tax that would otherwise \\nbe attributable to the City of Pittsburgh and file a return, but only shall pay the tax on  -9-  that portion of its Payroll Expense attributable to business activity for which a tax may \\nbe imposed pursuant to Section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. § 511.  \\nThat section imposes a federal tax on unrelated business taxable income of a charity \\nthat is exempt from  federal tax under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.  26 \\nU.S.C. § 501(c).  If the charity has purchased or is operating branches, affiliates, \\nsubsidiaries or other business entities that do not independently meet the standards of \\nthe “Institutio ns of Purely Public Charity Act”, the tax shall be paid on the payroll \\nattributable to such for -profit branches, affiliates or subsidiaries, whether or not the \\nemployees are leased or placed under the auspices of the charity’s umbrella or parent \\norganizati on.  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303(a.1).   \\ng. By reason of the explicit language in the Local Tax Enabling Act , 53 P.S. § \\n6924.303(a.1), Institutions of Purely Public Charity are n ot exempt from the Payroll Tax.   \\nHowever, Institutions of Purely Public Charity are exempt from Payroll Tax associated \\nwith activities that are related to the charit able purposes for which the Institution was \\nformed.  For purposes of determining whether an activity is related to the cha ritable \\npurposes for which the Institution was formed or unrelated under Section 511 of the \\nInternal Revenue  Code, 26 U.S.C. § 511, the Treasurer will follow federal law in effect \\non January 1, 20 20. \\nh. Any person, other than an Exempt Employer, that believes  that it is exempt from paying \\nthe Payroll Tax, because of a tax  exemption granted under federal, state , or local law \\nshall file its  return , caption the return “ EXEMPT ,” and provid e a short citation to the legal \\nbasis for its exemption.    \\n \\n   -10-  ARTICLE III  \\nEMPLOYER’S RESPONSIBILITY  \\nSECTION 301 – PAYROLL TAX LEVIED ON EMPLOYERS  \\na. Every Employer not registered with the City of Pittsburgh shall, within fifteen ( 15) days, \\nregister with the Treasurer the Employer’s name, address and such other information \\nas the Treasurer may require.  The first return for a new business is calculated on the \\nPayroll  Expense for the portion of the quarter it was in  business.  \\nb. The Payroll Tax is a tax that is levied on Employers.  Under  no circumstance  may the \\nPayroll Tax be deducted from the Employees’ wages.  \\nc. It may be necessary to include Form 1099’s issued to individuals in the  Employer’s \\ncalculations of the Payroll Tax.  See “Employee”  definition.  \\nd. It shall be the Employer’s responsib ility, upon request from the City of Pittsburgh, to \\nprovide a list of sub -contractors which includes their name, address, Federal Employer \\nIdentification Number ( EIN), contact person and their phone number.  \\nHistorical Note  - For the Years 2005 -2015 the Payroll Tax for the First Quarter was \\ndue February 28 based on Payroll Expense In October, November and December of \\nthe prior calendar year.  \\nEFFECTIVE FOR 2016 AND THEREAFTER, THE PAYROLL TAX FOR THE FIRST \\nQUARTER IS DUE ON MAY 31 BASED ON PAYROLL EXPENSE IN JANUARY, \\nFEBRUARY, AND MARCH OF THAT YEAR.  \\ne.

Intrastate \\nreceipts from services which are the result of business activities carried on through a \\nbranch office located outs ide Pittsburgh, are taxable if such services are performed in \\nPittsburgh  if the service is offered from the City . \\n(c) Persons engaging in any Institutional or non -profit service be it\\nprofessional, commercial , or personal services, are subject to the  tax. If a  person \\nengaging in any Institutional or non -profit service only maintains a place of business in \\nthe City of Pittsburgh, the entire receipts from intrastate activity  in the Commonwealth  \\nfrom personal services must be included in the measure of the tax, wh ether or not the \\nservices are performed in Pittsburgh. Receipts will be deemed attributable to Pittsburgh, \\nif they result from the efforts of employees who work in,  or from or are attached to \\ntaxpayer\\'s Pittsburgh place of business.   If any taxpayer is subject to Privilege tax in two \\nor more jurisdictions in Pennsylvania, he may request a ruling from the Treasurer  to \\naddress the issue of potential double taxation .  \\n(d) Receipts associated with interstate commerce shall be apportioned to\\nthe City by multiplying total receipts earned everywhere times the City Apportionment \\npercentage.  The City Apportionment percentage  is the sum of the following three \\napportionment factors:  Payroll  Percentage factor , Property  Percentage factor , and \\nSales Percentage  factor , divided by three . If one of the percentage factors is zero, the \\ndenominator shall be two.  If two of the percentage factors are zero, the dominator shall \\nbe one.   In no event can a percentage factor be less than zero.  \\n(1) The Payroll Percentage factor  shall be payroll reported by the\\ntaxpayer subject to City local earned income tax divided by total payroll reported on \\nFederal Form 940.  If the taxpayer only has one office in the Commonwealth and that \\noffice is in the City, the numerator  of the Payroll percentage factor shall be total payroll \\nreported to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.  \\n(2) The Property Percentage factor  shall be the sum of tangible\\nproperty located in the Cit y divided by the sum of tangible property located everywhere  \\nin the United States, determined as of December 31 .  Property shall be recorded at its \\noriginal cost before any depreciation , amortization, or cost depletion .  Leased property  -14-shall be recorded as an item of tangible property at eight  (8) times annual rent  for the \\nleased property .

If additional guidance is required with regard to the definition of Sales, \\nthe taxpayer shall follow the practice of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue \\nunder the Corporate Net Income Tax provisions of the Tax Reform Act, 72 P.S. § 7401, \\nso long as such pr actice is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Privilege Tax.  \\n(4) A taxpayer is engaged in interstate commerce if it is subject to tax\\nin another jurisdiction , outside the Commonwealth,  on its net income or on its gross \\nreceipts.   A taxpayer can show it is subject to tax in another jurisdiction by providing \\ncopies of tax returns  filed with taxing jurisdictions outside the Commonwealth.   If \\nintrastate receipts are co -mingled with interstate activity, all receipts shall be \\nconsidered interstate receipts.  \\n(5) If the application of the City apportionment percentage  results in\\nthe same gross receipts of the Taxpayer being taxable , for gross receipts or privilege \\ntax purposes,  by two or more jurisdictions  in the United States , the Taxpayer may \\napproach the Treasurer  for a ruling  to avoid this double taxation, such as receiving a \\ncredit for gross receipts or privilege taxes paid  elsewhere , or by a modification of the \\nCity apportionment percentage.   No credit will be granted by the City for net income \\ntaxes , excise taxes,  or transaction taxes  paid to another jurisdiction.   -15-ARTICLE V  \\nSUITS FOR COLLECTION, PENALTIES, ETC.  \\nSection  501. — Suits for Recovery of Unpaid T axes.  \\n(a) The following periods of limitations shall apply to suits for collection of\\ntaxes.  \\n(1) When a return has been filed but no tax paid, any suit brought to\\nrecover the tax due and unpaid shall be filed within three (3) years after the return was \\ndue or filed, whichever is later. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to file \\nsuit for the  collection of taxes.  \\n(2) In the case of a deficiency assessment, suit shall be filed within\\nthree (3) years after the assessment has been made.  \\n(b) The limitations set forth in paragraph (a) shall not prevent the institution\\nof a suit for the collection of any ta x due or determined to be due in the following cases:  \\n(1) When no return was filed, there is no limitation.\\n(2) When the return is fraudulent, there is no limitation.\\n(3) When there is an understatement of tax liability of twenty -five\\n(25%) or more, and not due to fra ud, suit must be begun within six (6) years.  \\n(4) A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the due\\ndate.  \\nSection 502 . — Penalty and Interest for N on-payment.  \\n(a) If, however, any Taxpayer shall fail to make any report and payment as\\nherein required a penalty at the rate of one-half  of one percent (0.5%) per month for \\neach month or a fraction of a whole month on the amount of tax and interest of one \\n(1%) percent per month for each month or fraction of a whole month during the period \\nin which the tax remains unpaid shall be added to the tax.  In no event shall the \\ninterest rate assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the Municipal Claims and \\nTax Liens Act, 53 P.S. §7143, or applicable law. \\n(b) There is no limit or cut off point, for applying penalty and interest.\\n(c) On any additional tax determined to be due as a result of a deficiency\\nassessment, penalty and interest will be assessed from the day the tax should have \\nbeen paid to t he date of payment.  Penalty and interest is calculated as described \\nabove.  \\n(d) Where suit is brought for the recovery of such tax, the person liable\\ntherefore shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection and the interest and \\npenalties herein impo sed. Once due and owing, penalty and interest become part of \\nthe tax and shall be collected as such. A person’s belief that no tax is due and owing, \\nor the failure of any person to receive or obtain the forms required for making the \\nreturns required under the City Code is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties \\nherein for violation.  Good faith shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty.   -16-Section  503. – Fines and Penalties for Violation of Act.  \\n(a) Whoever willfully makes any false or untrue  statement on the return shall,\\nupon summary conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than five \\nhundred dollars ($500.00) or to undergo imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) \\ndays.  \\n(b) Whoever willfully fails or refuses to appear before the Treasurer, in\\nperson with his books, records or accounts for  examination when required under the \\nprovisions of the Institution and Service Privilege Tax Ordinance, to do so, or who \\nwillfully refuses to permit inspection of the books, records or accounts of any services \\nin custody or control,  when the right to make such inspection by the Treasurer is \\nrequested,  shall upon summary conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not \\nmore than Five Hundred Dollars  ($500.00), or to undergo imprisonm ent for not more \\nthan thirty (30 ) days.  \\n(c) Whoever willfully fails or refuses to file a return required by the  Instit ution\\nand Service Privilege Tax Ordinance , shall, upon summary conviction thereof, be \\nsentenced to pay a fine of not more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), or undergo \\nimprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days . \\nSection 504 . – Remedies Not Mutually Exclusive  \\nThe remedies provided in this Article are not mutually exclusive.  The utilization by the \\nTreasurer of one remedy does n ot preclude utilization of the other.  \\nMoreover, use of either or both of the remedies provided in these Sections does not \\npreclude the use by the City of Pittsburgh of any other legal or administrative procedure \\nwhich can bring about compliance by the Taxp ayer with the provisions of Chapter 241 \\nof the Pittsburgh Code and these regulations.  \\nOnce it has been determined that that a Taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take \\nall actions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining  \\nadditional information, auditing Taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the \\ndisputed amount of the tax, or obtaining liens on the Taxpayer’s property, wage \\nattachments, levies, and seizures and sales of the Taxpayer’s property in appropriate \\ncircumstances. The Treasurer may enter into a written agreement with the Taxpayer for \\npayment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will \\nfacilitate collection.

The \\npro rata share shall be determined by dividing the rate of the Local Services Tax levied for the \\ncalendar year by  the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar \\nyear. Example:  $52 /26 pay periods equal $2 per pay.  Employers are required to remit the  \\nLocal Services Tax thirty days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

How is the LST deducted from the employee’s pay and remitted to the City? Example, \\nemployees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more.  What is  \\nthe employer’s  responsibility?  \\nANSWER:  The employer is required to withhold the pro -rata share of the tax by dividing  \\n$52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. \\nThe $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per \\nmonth for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculat ing the pro -rata share, employers are \\nrequired to round down to the nearest one -hundredth of a dollar.  \\nThe employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The  \\ntax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The  LST forms can be \\ndownloaded  at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  \\n2. At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City  \\nfor the entire  calendar  year.  Should  the employer  withhold  the LST?  \\nANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that \\nhe will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to  \\nwithhold the LST.  The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available  \\nfor employees to  complete.  \\nThe exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/fin ance  \\n3. A new hire files an exemption certificate with his employer. The employer and his \\nemployee realize with 13 weeks left in the year that he will earn $12,000 because he is \\nworking more hours than anticipated. He is paid weekly. Is his employer responsib le for \\nwithholding the LST now?  \\nANSWER: Yes. After the employer realizes that the employee will  earn  $12,000  or \\nmore, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch -up then  \\n$1.00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of  $52. \\n4. Employee has two part -time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year \\nand another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year. Does this person need to  \\npay the  LST?  \\nANSWER: No.  The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate w ith both employers  \\nand have  no LST deducted.  The Taxpayer  is not subject  to the LST since  he did not earn \\n$12,000 in any single municipality. If the tax was withheld the employee could file a  \\nrefund claim with each municipality after January 31 of the following year. The refund \\nrequest form can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  - the form is \\nlisted  as LST REFUND  FORM.  \\n5. An individual works January thru June in the City and July thru December in Municipality \\n“A”. He earns $10,000 a month at both jobs and is paid once a week. What is his liability \\nto Pittsburgh?  \\nANSWER: His employer in the City should withhold $1 a week for 26 pay periods and \\nremit $26 along with his other employees’ deductions to the City. Municipality “A” would \\nbe entitled to the LST for the 2nd half of the year. The emp loyee should provide proof of \\nLST paid for the first half of the year to Municipality “A”.   -7-  6. An individual works July thru December in the City. He did not work January thru June, \\nanywhere. He earns $10,000 a month. Does he owe the $52 LST to t he City?  \\nANSWER: Yes. His employer knows that this employee is over  the  $12,000  low  \\nincome exemption level. No exemption certificate has been filed. The $52 may be \\nprorated for the rest of the year; however the employer should withhold $52 because that  \\nis what  the employee  owes.  \\nSECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the \\nprior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current \\npayroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid \\nonce a week, h e would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be \\ndeducted from one paycheck.  \\n7. An employee has 2 jobs and both are part time. Both started at the beginning of January. \\nJob #1 is in the City and pays the employee $1,000 a month. Job #2 is in Municipality “A” \\nand paid the taxpayer $500. Where should the tax be  paid?  \\nANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the \\nmost should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City. The LST \\nshoul d be paid to the City. The employee should file an exemption certificate with \\nMunicipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City.  \\n8. On January 1, an employee worked for an employer in Municipality “A” and paid $10. In \\nJune the emplo yee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job.   \\nIs the employer  required  to withhold  the LST from the employee?  \\nANSWER: Yes. The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid) \\nif the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”. Then the \\nemployer must pro -rate the $42  based on the remaining payroll  periods.  \\nSECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the \\nprior periods that  were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current \\npayroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid \\nonce a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be \\ndeducted from one p aycheck.  \\n9. An employee files his exemption certificate late. The employer has already withheld $52. \\nCan the employee  apply  for a refund?  \\nANSWER: Yes. The employee should request the refund from the employer. It is \\npermissible and recommended that his employe r refund the current year LST and make \\nan adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year.  \\nIf the employer does not refund the LST, the employee can apply for a refund from the \\nCity after the employer’s fourth quarter paymen t and summary form is filed at the end of \\nJanuary of the following year (see Section 301(j)).  \\nThe City is not required to pay interest until 75 days after the fourth quarter or when the \\ntaxpayer files for a refund, whichever is later.   -7-  10. Employe e works 4 months in the City and earns $20,000. His employer  is  located \\noutside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Is the employee required to pay the $52 \\nLST?  \\nANSWER:   Yes. \\n11. Is a self -employed person or a  partner who has an office in the City or who works out  \\nof his home  located in the City subject to the  LST?  \\nANSWER:  Yes.   A self -employed person or partner is subject to the $52   LST.  The \\ntax may be  prorated and paid  quarterly.  \\n \\nARTICLE III \\nCOLLECTION AT SOUR CE \\nSECTION 301 – COLLECTION THROUGH EMPLOYERS  \\na. Every employer not registered with the City shall, within 15 days after first becoming an \\nemployer, register with the City the employer’s name, address and such other information \\nas the City may  require.  \\nb. All em ployers and self -employed individuals are required to collect the Local Services Tax \\nfrom all employees engaged in an occupation within the City, unless the employee files  \\nan Exemption certificate with the employer. Exemption certificates must indicate a basis \\nfor exemption  and must  be retained  for 3 years.  \\nc. Employers are required to remit the Local Services Tax within thirty (30) days after the \\nend of each quarter of a calendar year. For purposes of this tax, sole proprietors and \\npartners  shall be deemed  to be employees.  \\nWHEN TO FILE AND PAY – The employer shall file a return of taxes deducted for each \\nthree -month period (quarter) on or before the last day of the month following each three - \\nmonth period.  \\nFIRST  QUARTER  (03):  January  1 thru March  31 (due April 30) \\nSECOND  QUARTER  (06):  April 1 thru June  30 (due July 31) \\nTHIRD  QUARTER  (09):  July 1 thru September  30 (due October  31) \\nFOURTH  QUARTER  (12):  October  1 thru December  31 (due January  31) \\nd.

The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the employee from the duty \\nto file a return and pay the tax. The employee must first contact the City of Pittsburgh \\nFinance Department at 412-255-2510 then file an LS -3 form. No employer shall be held \\nliable for failure to withhold the Local Services Tax to a political subdivision if the failure to \\nwithhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the \\nemployee’s place or places of employmen t. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as \\nrequired by this section, or who fails to pay the tax to the Treasurer,  shall be liable  for \\nsuch  tax in full.  -8-  As to employees who present official receipts evidencing prior payment of the tax either \\ndirectly or by collection through other employers in Pennsylvania, the employer shall not \\ndeduct the tax but shall maintain adequate records concerning the employees.  \\nf. The employer must list on the employee’s pay stub how much was withheld and list the \\nmunicipality it was paid to . List PITTSBURGH as  “PGH ”. \\ng. Upfront Exemption . Employers are required to discontinue withholding the LST if an \\nemployee provides an exemption certificate showing that he has earned income and/or \\nnet profits of less than $12,000. The exemption certificate must verify that the employee \\nreasonably expec ts to receive earned income and/or net profits of less than $12,000 from \\nall sources within the City for the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. \\nA copy of the employee’s final pay stubs or W -2 forms from employment within Pittsburgh  \\nfor the year prior to the calendar year for which the employee is requesting an exemption \\nmust be attached to the exemption certificate. Employers must make upfront exemption \\nforms readily available to employees at all times and provide new employees with  the \\nforms at the time of hiring. Employers are relieved of liability due to incorrect information \\non the exemption  certificate  completed  by the employee.  \\nEmployers are only required to withhold the LST on a payroll period basis for those \\npayroll periods i n which the taxpayer is employed. However, when two or more  employers \\nemploy a taxpayer in a payroll period, an employer is not required to withhold the LST if \\nthe taxpayer provides a pay stub from his/her principal employer accompanied by an \\nemployee stat ement of principal employment that the pay stub is from the taxpayer’s \\nprincipal employer and that the taxpayer will notify the employer of any change in \\nemployment.  Employers  are relieved  of liability  for the tax if they fail to withhold  the tax due \\nto incorrect information provided by the taxpayer regarding the taxpayer’s principal \\nemployer.  \\nh. Military Exemption . Employers must exempt from the LST: (1) members of a reserve \\ncomponent of the armed forces called to active duty and (2) honorably discha rged \\nveterans who served in any war or armed conflict who are blind, paraplegic, or a double \\nor quadruple amputee as a result of military service or who are 100% disabled from a \\nservice -connected  disability.  \\ni. Restoration of Withholding . Employers must “rest art” withholding the LST from an \\nemployee  who files an exemption  certificate  in the following  circumstances:  \\n\\uf0b7 If instructed  to do so by the political  subdivision  levying  the LST;  \\n\\uf0b7 If notified  by the employee  that he is no longer  eligible  for the exemption;  or \\n\\uf0b7 If the employer  pays  the employee  $12,000  or more  for the calendar  year.  \\nEmployers “restart” withholding of the LST by withholding (1) a “catch -up” lump sum  \\nequal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the employee as a result of the \\nexemption; and (2) the same amount per payroll period that is withheld from other \\nemployees.  \\nj. The employer must attach a summary on a CD or hard copy with the fourth quarter \\npayment  listing  the following  information:  \\n\\uf0b7 Employer’s name, address in Pittsburgh, Federal ID number, and the employer’s City \\naccount  number.   -9-  \\uf0b7 The summary must include an employee’s name, Social Security number, wages, \\naddress and the amount of Local Service Tax withheld and paid to Pittsburgh for the \\ncomplete calendar  year.  \\n\\uf0b7 Please see the LST tax form at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  for the format to \\nuse on  CD. \\n\\uf0b7 Concurrent Employment. If a taxpayer has two or more jobs in different political \\nsubdivisions during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the LST is as \\nfollows:  \\n1. Where  the taxpayer  maintains  his principal  office  or is principally  employed;  \\n2. Where  the taxpayer  resides  and works;  and \\n3. Where  the taxpayer  is employed  that is nearest  in miles  to the taxpayer’s  home.  \\nk. If any employer fails or refuses to pay over to the Treasurer any tax required to be \\nwithheld under this section by the due date, a penalty of 5% for every month or fraction \\nthereof that the tax remains unpaid shall be added and collected, the penalty is c apped at \\n50%. Interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum on the amount of tax unpaid \\nfor each month or fraction of a month that tax remains unpaid shall be added and \\ncollected.  \\nSECTION 302 – DIRECT PAYMENT BY TAXPAYER  \\nEvery taxpayer who is self -employed, a partner, or any taxpayer that did not have the tax \\nwithheld for any other reason, shall file a LS -3 form and shall pay the tax directly to the \\nTreasurer.  The tax is  $52 and should  be pro-rated  and paid on a quarterly  basis.  Taxpayers  shall \\nfile and pay the tax  30 days after the end of each quarter.  \\nSECTION 303 – LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES  \\nAny employer required to withhold the tax in accordance with the City Code and with these \\nRegulations shall be personally liable for paymen t of the tax in the event he fails, refuses or \\nneglects to withhold or transmit the tax or any portion thereof, in addition to the interest and \\npenalties. Any taxes deducted and withheld from employees, plus any penalties and interest \\nthereon, constitute a  trust fund for the benefit of the City. The failure to timely remit such funds \\nallows the City to collect such trust funds from the employer, the employer’s representative, or \\nany other person receiving such trust funds.  53 P.S. § 6924.705(b)(1).  \\nThe failure or omission of any employer to make the correct deductions required by this section \\nshall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or the balance determined to be due, \\ntogether with penalty and interest from the date the tax was due , or from complying with the \\nrequirements of the Code relating to the filing of declarations and returns.  \\nARTICLE IV \\nADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT  \\nSECTION 401 – POWERS AND DUTIES OF TREASURER  \\na.

Such  action  may include  obtaining  additional  information, \\nauditing taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of the tax, or \\nobtaining liens on the taxpayer’s property, wage attachmen ts, levies, and seizures and sales \\nof the taxpayer’s  property  in appropriate  circumstances.  The Treasurer  may enter  into a written \\nagreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes \\nthat such an agreement will faci litate collection. The Treasurer may also impose interest and \\napplicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek criminal charges in appropriate \\ncircumstances.

The limitations set forth in paragraph (a) should not prevent the institution of a suit for \\nthe collection  of any tax due or determined  to be due in the following  cases:  \\n1. When  no return  was filed,  there  is no limitation.  \\n2. When  the return  is fraudulent,  there  is no limitation.  \\n3. When there is an understatement of tax liability of twenty -five percent (25%) or more, \\nand not due to fraud, suit must begin within six (6)  years.  \\nc. Deficiency  assessments  (i.e., where  taxpayer  has filed a return  in good  faith but is found \\nto owe additional tax) shall include taxes for three  (3) years prior to  the  date  when \\nthe deficiency is assessed. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to the \\nperiod of assessment. A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the \\ndue date.   -12-  SECTION 504 – PENALTY AND INTEREST  \\na. If for any reason the Local Services Tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate       \\nof twelve percent (12%) per annum on the amount of tax and an additional penalty of \\nfive percent (5%) per month for each month or fraction of a month during the perio d in \\nwhich the tax remains unpaid shall be added to the tax. 53 P.S. § 6924.706.

A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is hereby  imposed  upon  each  \\nparking  transaction  by a patron  of a non-residential  parking  place  at the rate of \\nthirty -seven  and one-half (37.5)  percent  for all transactions  occurring  on or after \\nJanuary  1, 2009.  The rate of tax may be changed  for any tax year by the \\nlegislative  actions  of the Mayor and City Council.   However, the tax rate may not \\nexceed the rate permitted by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and \\nRecovery Act , 53 P.S. § 895.902.  \\n \\n(b) Calculation  of tax. The following  method  must  be used  to compute  the tax, \\nwhether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  \\nindividual  tax collections  are not kept for each  ticket :  \\n \\nSimplified Calculation .  For ease of administration and tax collection,  the tax \\nreturn presumes that gross collections include both total consideration from the \\npatron and collected parking tax  from the patron . Under this simplified \\ncalculation the applicable tax rates is 27.273% times gross collections.  \\n \\n The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as follows:  \\n \\nParking  Fee X Tax Rate  = Parking  Tax Due \\n \\nFor example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%:  \\n \\n$1,000.00  X 37.5%  = $375.00  \\n$1,550.00  X 37.5%  = $581.25  \\n \\n(c) Calculation  of total  payment.  The following  method  shall be used  to compute  \\nthe total payment  collected  by the  operator  and paid by the  patron,  whether  the tax \\ntotal is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are \\nnot kept for each  ticket.  The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as \\nfollows:  \\n \\nParking  Fee + Parking  Tax = Total  Payment  \\n \\nFor example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%:  \\n$1,000.00  + $375.00  = $1,375.00  \\n$1,550.00  + $581.25  = $2,131.25  \\n \\n(d) Calculation  of total  payment where  there  is a surcharge.  The following method  \\nshall be used  to compute  the total payment  collected  by the operator  and paid by \\nthe patron  when  a surcharge  is imposed,  whether  the tax total is taken  from \\nindividual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each  \\nticket.  The parking  tax will be applied  to the sum of the base  parking  fee and the \\nsurcharge.  The rate of  tax is defined above  and will be applied  as follows:  \\n  -11-  (Base  Fee + Surcharge)   + Tax Rate(Base Fee  + Surcharge) = Total  Payment  \\n \\nFor example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%  and the surcharge  is $10: \\n($1,000.00  + $10.00)  + $378.75  = $1,388.75  \\n($1,550.00  + $10.00)  + $585.00  = $2,145.00  \\n \\n§ 302.  COLLECTION  OF TAX.  \\n \\n(a) Collection  by operator  or provider .  A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is imposed  \\nupon  each  patron  entering into  a parking transaction,  at the specified  rate of  the \\nconsideration for each such  transaction,  which  tax shall be collected by the operator  \\nfrom the patron,  and shall be paid over to the Treasurer as set forth in Chapter 253  \\nof the Pittsburgh  Code.  \\n \\n(b) Creation  of a trust.  All taxes  collected by any operator in accordance  with the \\nPittsburgh  Code,  Chapter 253  shall constitute a trust fund for the benefit  of the City \\nand such trust  shall be enforceable  against  the operator  and any person  receiving  \\nany part of such  fund without  consideration,  or with knowledge  that the operator is  \\ncommitting a breach  of trust;  provided  however,  that any person  receiving payment  \\nof a lawful  obligation  of the operator  from such fund shall be presumed  to have  \\nreceived  the same  in good faith and  without  any knowledge  of the  breach of  trust.  \\n \\n(c) Liability  of the  operator.

Moreover,  use \\nof any or all of the remedies  provided  in these  Sections  does  not preclude  the use by the \\nCity of any other  legal  or administrative  procedure  which  can bring  about  compliance  by \\nthe operator with  the provisions  of the  Code  and these Regulations.  \\n \\nOnce it has been determined that that a taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all \\nactions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional \\ninformation, auditing taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of \\nthe tax, or obtaining liens on the taxpayer’s property, wage attachments, levies, and \\nseizures and sales of  the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer \\nmay enter into a written agreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments \\nif the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer \\nmay also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek criminal \\ncharges in appropriate circumstances.

PENALTY  AND  INTEREST.  \\n \\n(a) If for any reason the  Parking Tax is not paid in  whole or in part  when  due, a penalty  \\nat the rate of five percent  (5%) per month  of the amount  of the Parking Tax will be \\nadded  and collected  as penalty  for every  month  or fraction  thereof  during the time \\nthe Parking Tax  goes  unpaid,  such  penalty  not to  exceed fifty  percent  (50%).  \\nOnce  due and owing,  penalty  becomes  part of the Parking Tax.  \\n \\n(b) In addition to the penalty,  interest  of one percent  (1%)  for every  month  or fraction  \\nthereof  will be added to  the delinquent  tax balance  which  will continue  to accrue  \\nuntil the full  payment  of the tax principal  is made.   In no event shall the interest rate \\nassessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens \\nAct, 53 P.S. 7143, or applic able law.  \\n \\n(c) On any additional  Parking Fee  determined to be due as a result  of a deficiency  \\nnotice,  penalty  and interest  will be assessed from  the day the Parking Tax should  \\nhave  been  paid to the date of payment.  Penalty  and interests  are calculated  in \\nSection 602(a) and 602(b),  respectively.  \\n \\n(d) Where  suit is brought  for the recovery  of the Parking Tax,  the person  liable therefor  \\nshall,  in addition,  be liable for the costs  of collection , penalties,  and interest  herein  \\nimposed.  \\n \\n(e) A person’s  belief  that no Parking  Tax is due and owing,  or the failure of  any person  \\nto receive  or obtain the forms required  for making the returns  required  by the Code  \\nis not a valid defense to  the imposition  of penalties  for violation herein.

       "  'content': 'Carnegie Mellon University — — — Search Search CMU › About ›\\xa0             History Andrew Carnegie A self-educated \"working boy\" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world\\'s largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century. Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that \"to die rich is to die disgraced.\" He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. \"My heart is in the work,\" he stated, which would become part of the school\\'s official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. Carnegie Tech – Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor\\'s degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or \"Carnegie Tech.\" During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the \\'Carnegie Plan\\' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948: The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business , focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science. 1968: School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the H. John Heinz III College , providing graduate training for work in the public sector. 1986: School of Computer Science , pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences . In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery. A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda. The Future CMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900. At the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU research, innovation and creativity will continue to guide our future as a world-class university. As outlined in the Strategic Plan 2025 , the university will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.

Other experiences blossomed from the minds of students (The Fence). Kiltie Band This kilt-clad student marching band — the self-named \" Band Without Pants \" — has entertained home football games with songs, chants, cheers and a quirky sense of humor since 1922. The Fence The Fence is painted between midnight and sunrise by students who then stand guard as long as they want their message to stay. Fun Fact: The original Fence was once the \"most painted object in the world\" until it collapsed and was replaced by a steel-concrete fence. Spring Carnival The entire community comes together for this four-day festival, Carnegie Mellon\\'s oldest tradition. Buggy Sweepstakes A Spring Carnival highlight, students race \" buggies ,\" often reaching up to 35 mph. Student groups design and build the aerodynamic cylinders — \"pushmobiles,\" as they were called when the tradition started in 1920. Bagpipers It doesn\\'t get more Scottish than bagpipes. Carnegie Mellon\\'s Pipes and Drums can be found practicing around campus and performing at formal university events. Autographs Behind the stage of Kresge Theatre senior \"dramats\" ( drama students) sign the walls and ceiling before graduating.

These efforts are ongoing and remain critical to our university\\'s mission to advance learning, research, and creativity and make a positive impact on society more broadly.\" Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President\\'s Chair “As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values.” Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in society’s opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries. Others make a more serious effort at collecting information. Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective. The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent. For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek.

15	 Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide
16	 As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells
17	 Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene
18	 Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”)
19	 The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves
20	 Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside
21	 Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”)
22	 Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”)
23	 When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa
24	 Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day
25	 Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti
26	 When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space
27	 Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers
28	 Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”)
29	 ACT II
30	 In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”)
31	 The spy Spoletta arrives
32	 He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs
33	 She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture
34	 Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place
35	 Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side
36	 Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison
37	 Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life
38	 Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”)
39	 Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself
40	 Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition
41	 The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves
42	 As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand
43	 ACT III
44	 The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn
45	 Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca
46	 Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”)
47	 Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures
48	 Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future
49	 As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart
50	 Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real
51	 When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death

15	 Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide
16	 As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells
17	 Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene
18	 Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”)
19	 The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves
20	 Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside
21	 Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”)
22	 Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”)
23	 When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa
24	 Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day
25	 Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti
26	 When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space
27	 Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers
28	 Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”)
29	 ACT II
30	 In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”)
31	 The spy Spoletta arrives
32	 He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs
33	 She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture
34	 Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place
35	 Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side
36	 Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison
37	 Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life
38	 Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”)
39	 Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself
40	 Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition
41	 The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves
42	 As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand
43	 ACT III
44	 The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn
45	 Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca
46	 Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”)
47	 Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures
48	 Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future
49	 As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart
50	 Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real
51	 When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death

15	 Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide
16	 As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells
17	 Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene
18	 Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”)
19	 The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves
20	 Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside
21	 Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”)
22	 Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”)
23	 When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa
24	 Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day
25	 Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti
26	 When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space
27	 Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers
28	 Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”)
29	 ACT II
30	 In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”)
31	 The spy Spoletta arrives
32	 He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs
33	 She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture
34	 Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place
35	 Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side
36	 Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison
37	 Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life
38	 Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”)
39	 Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself
40	 Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition
41	 The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves
42	 As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand
43	 ACT III
44	 The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn
45	 Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca
46	 Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”)
47	 Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures
48	 Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future
49	 As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart
50	 Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real
51	 When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death

15	 Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide
16	 As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells
17	 Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene
18	 Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”)
19	 The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves
20	 Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside
21	 Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”)
22	 Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”)
23	 When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa
24	 Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day
25	 Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti
26	 When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space
27	 Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers
28	 Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”)
29	 ACT II
30	 In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”)
31	 The spy Spoletta arrives
32	 He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs
33	 She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture
34	 Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place
35	 Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side
36	 Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison
37	 Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life
38	 Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”)
39	 Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself
40	 Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition
41	 The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves
42	 As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand
43	 ACT III
44	 The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn
45	 Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca
46	 Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”)
47	 Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures
48	 Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future
49	 As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart
50	 Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real
51	 When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death

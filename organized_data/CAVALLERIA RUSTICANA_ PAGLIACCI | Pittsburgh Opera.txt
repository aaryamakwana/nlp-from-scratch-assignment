13	 At dawn on Easter Sunday, Turiddu sings in the distance of his love for Lola, wife of the carter Alfio
14	 She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army
15	 When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola
16	 Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu’s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine
17	 But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village
18	 Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses—and of Lola
19	 He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine
20	 When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning
21	 Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet
22	 As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia
23	 The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass
24	 Turiddu arrives in the piazza
25	 When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations
26	 Just then Lola passes by on her way to church
27	 She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her
28	 Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her
29	 Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him
30	 Alfio appears, late for Mass
31	 Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him
32	 In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza
33	 Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia’s tavern
34	 Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears
35	 He refuses Turiddu’s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight
36	 Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza’s sake as well as for his honor
37	 The two men agree to meet outside the village
38	 Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn’t come back, then runs off to the fight
39	 As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance
40	 A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed
41	 PAGLIACCI PROLOGUE Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people
42	 ACT I The same Sicilian village, 1949
43	 A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night’s performance to the gathered crowd
44	 One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio’s young wife, Nedda
45	 Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same
46	 As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband’s jealousy
47	 She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom
48	 Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge
49	 In fact, Nedda does have a lover—Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears
50	 The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night
51	 Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized
52	 Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover’s name
53	 Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening’s performance to catch the culprit
54	 Alone, Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking
55	 ACT II That evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them
56	 Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda
57	 He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine’s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio
58	 When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away
59	 Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife’s innocence, which ignites Canio’s jealousy
60	 Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover
61	 She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps
62	 In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid
63	 Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over

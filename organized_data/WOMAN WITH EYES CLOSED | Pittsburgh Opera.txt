3	 Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young
4	 The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings
5	 This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon ( Cold Mountain ) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!

12	 The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit
13	 In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona
14	 In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece
15	 One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core
16	 The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child
17	 The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life
18	 The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door
19	 Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix
20	 The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime
21	 It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended
22	 Mona must act quickly
23	 Night falls
24	 Mona sleeps
25	 As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life
26	 Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite
27	 Inside this memory, the two women examine the past
28	 They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection
29	 Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future
30	 With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings whilesimultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go

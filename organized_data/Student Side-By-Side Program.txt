64	 Our previous concert and sectionals What's it like to be part of the program? The opportunity to play at Heinz Hall with the PSO was amazing and also really fun! It introduced me to the basics of how professional orchestras work and gave me the opportunity to get feedback from professionals!" I really appreciated the welcoming and comfortable environment of the Side-by-Side program
65	 This was made possible by my great stand partner and everyone that participated in and helped run the program
66	" I really liked the exciting atmosphere and environment that the conductor created every time we had rehearsal
67	" This was one of my all-time best memories
68	 Listening to the PSO or even rehearsing with PSO musicians can never quite replicate the astonishing feeling you get performing with world class musicians for an enthusiastic audience in a beautiful hall
69	" I feel much better prepared to tackle harder music and larger ensembles as my musical career continues
70	" In Side-by-Side, I was able to make so many friends as everyone there was driven by the same passions and had shared interests with me
71	 It felt like people truly cared and appreciated music
72	" Frequently Asked Questions Do I need to audition or submit a video? No, there is no video or in-person audition required to participate in the Side-by-Side program
73	 All you need is the application and teacher recommendation
74	 How advanced of a musician do I need to be? Any level of musician can apply! Within the application, particular emphasis is placed on the teacher recommendation section for this reason
75	 Do I have to take private lessons? No! Your teacher recommendation can be from a music teacher at school or from a private teacher
76	 Do I need to be accepted into a music program after high school to apply? Not at all! Side-by-Side is for all high school student musicians, regardless of your plans after high school
77	 You just have to be in grades 9-12, play an instrument, and love music! How challenging is the repertoire? While it’s not the most difficult music in the world, it’s still designed to help challenge and broaden your musical skills

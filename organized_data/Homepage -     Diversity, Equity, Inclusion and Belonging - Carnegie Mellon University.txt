16	 Hillman President's Chair “As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence
17	 Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values
18	” Dr
19	 Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in society’s opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change
20	 This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others
21	 Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results
22	 Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results
23	 Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities
24	 Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way
25	 Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways
26	 Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc)
27	 Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong
28	 Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them

1	 If you have objects, photographs, artwork, digital material, or documents that you believe would be of potential interest to our collection, we would like to hear from you
2	 To start the donation process, please tell us about your materials by filling out an Collection Donation Form 
3	 The more information provided about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania, the easier it is for our Collections Committee to assess
4	 An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is also appreciated
5	 Donate to the Collection For additional questions or information, please email acquisitions@heinzhistorycenter
6	org 
7	 Frequently Asked Questions How do I offer historic materials? Please use on our online form to offer historic materials
8	 Please do not bring materials to the History Center without an appointment
9	 Tell us anything you know about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania
10	 For example, you might explain who owned them and when or how they were used or why they were produced
11	 An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is appreciated
12	 The material will then be assessed by our Collections Committee and you will be notified of their decision
13	 What is collected? Materials that document the lives of Western Pennsylvanians and the history of the region up to and including the present
14	 Historic materials can take many forms, such as personal letters, business records, uniforms, tools, local souvenirs, paintings of Western Pennsylvania, published books or family scrapbooks, hand-made quilts, and Pittsburgh manufactured products
15	 The most important criterion for donation is that the materials say something about this region
16	 It is important to provide as much detail as you can about the articles you wish to donate, this will help the Collections Committee make a more informed decision
17	 Are all donations accepted? We cannot accept everything
18	 Organizing, cataloging, and preserving historical materials for the future takes so much space, time, and money, that donations must be selected very carefully
19	 Staff review each offer and compare it with what we already have in the collection, they assess its condition and determine what it tells us about life in Western Pennsylvania
20	 Normally, objects and artwork need to be seen before a decision can be made
21	 Will my materials be put on display at the History Center? Unless we designate your materials for a specific exhibit, they will not be put on display immediately
22	 What you see at the History Center is only a very small part of the collections
23	 That is because we have limited gallery space and because long-term display can have negative effects on preservation
24	 The rest are carefully catalogued and stored in a temperature controlled environment so that they will be available for future exhibits at the History Center, for loan to other museums, or for research and reference for generations to come
25	 What should I do to get my donation ready? Please do nothing to the items
26	 We prefer to see them in their original condition
27	 Do not clean, repaint, refinish, or “spruce up” historical materials before giving them to us
28	 Please provide as much related historical information as possible
29	 For example, if you plan to offer your grandfather’s report card, you might also offer photographs of him as a student, samples of his school papers and the cap he wore at school
30	 If you have photographs it is helpful to make copies and identify the people and locations in the images
31	 How can I see my materials if they are not on display? Documents, photographs and published materials are available for research and reference in the Detre Library & Archives at the History Center during regular hours 
32	 Requests to see artwork and objects should be made to the collections manager at 412-454-6434
33	 Please give our curators and archivists at least two weeks advance notice
34	 Is my donation tax deductible? Yes
35	 The donor is responsible for determining and documenting the value of a donation
36	 Staff at the History Center cannot appraise materials
37	 They can give you a list of certified appraisers
38	 Can I lend, rather than donate, my historic materials? Or, can my heirs get things back if they are no displayed? Materials are not accepted on long term loan, nor can agreements be made to return materials to heirs
39	 Occasionally, short term loans for specific exhibits are accepted
40	 The Deed of Gift, signed by every donor, gives the History Center clear ownership of the materials
41	 The History Center accepts responsibility for preserving each donation for generations to come
42	 Can I bequeath materials in my will? Yes
43	 Please contact us and let us know of the planned bequest
44	 We appreciate having the opportunity to learn the story behind the materials
45	 We can also explain in further detail the appropriate phrasing for your documents
46	 Please note, bequests must meet collections requirements
47	 How is the decision to accept or decline a donation offer made? Each item or collection is different, but factors that contribute to the decision include, but are not limited to, its historical or cultural significance to the Western Pennsylvania region, physical condition, whether or not the museum already owns a similar item or copy, and its ownership history
48	 How can I tell if the Detre Library & Archives already owns an item? With limited space and resources, our interest is in building the collection where gaps exist or in area of particular interest
49	 In general, we are not interested in adding items that duplicate those already in the collection
50	 You can search the Library & Archives holdings here 
51	 What happens to my collection after it is donated? Each item or collection that is donated is assigned a unique number and entered into the online catalog
52	 Depending on the size of a collection, more work might need to be done prior to it being accessible to the public
53	 This includes, but limited to, organizing, re-housing materials in acid-free folders, addressing minor preservation needs, and writing a finding aid to the collection
54	 Does the Detre Library & Archives ever purchase items? Very rarely does the Detre Library & Archives purchase a collection
55	 On these occasions, we cannot suggest or set a purchase price
56	 This must be set by the seller
57	 Can tell me more about this object? For assistance in identifying historical materials or learning more about them, please email acquisitions@heinzhistorycenter
58	org 
59	 While we do not provide appraisals, our team can suggest ways to locate certified appraisers

== Etymology ==

Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham
31	 As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name  PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh)

35	 by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be 
36	
37	
38	 erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever

The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River
46	 European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century
47	 Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements

58	
During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes
59	 By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois
60	 A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh"
61	 Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania
62	 On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier
63	
On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township

85	 Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany
86	
Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city
87	 There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels
88	 The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom
89	 The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad
90	 Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada
91	 Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties

111	6% of the city's population
112	 Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century
113	 Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers
114	
During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort
115	 This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry
116	 The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy" was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off
117	"

118	 The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development
119	 The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring
120	 There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures
121	
In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics
122	 Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs
123	 While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again

195	S
196	 Census Bureau
197

198	" In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia", recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia
199	


=== Climate ===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used
200	 Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature
201	 Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U
202	S
203	 The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a
204	 The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm
205	 As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%
206	
The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73
207	2 °F (22
208	9 °C)
209	 Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9
210	5 days a year, a considerable heat index arises
211	 The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28
212	8 °F (−1
213	8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2
214	6 nights per year
215	 Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901
216	 Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995
217	
Average annual precipitation is 39
218	61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22

226	 In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%)
227	


==== Air quality ====
The American Lung Association's (ALA) 2023 “State of the Air” report (which included data from 2019 to 2021) showed air quality in Pittsburgh improving
228	 The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog
229	
According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time
230	 Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an “80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023
231	
A past 2019 "State of the Air" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution
232	 In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three
233	
In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U
234	S
235	 metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U
236	S
237	 metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh
238	 For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U
239	S
240	 metro areas
241	 The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey
242	 The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging
243	 The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U
244	S
245	 Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey
246	 The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia
247	
Although the county was still below the "pass" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure
248	 Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999
249	 ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated "It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county 
250	
251	
252	 We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more
253	"
As of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets
254	 A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality
255	 Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis
256	 The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance
257	
Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects
258	 In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average
259	 The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter
260	 Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh
261	 The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities
262	 This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism
263	
Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh
264	 WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education
265	 In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched
266	 As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities
267	


==== Water quality ====
The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits
268	 This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure
269	 Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater
270	 The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959
271	 Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water
272	 As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers
273	 Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations
274	 The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions
275	 In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019
276	
Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates
277	 They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement
278	 In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority
279	 Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)
280	
PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water
281	 Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels
282	 In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties
283	 By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality
284	 Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014, from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection
285	 Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water
286	
In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases
287	 The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water
288	 Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit
289	 In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia
290	 In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water
291	 Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water
292	 PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead
293	
There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system
294	 Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children
295	 Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area
296	 These levels were about 11 times the legal limit
297	 Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program

=== Demographic changes ===
Since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment
387	
Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena
388	 This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961
389	 The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns
390	 An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority
391	 The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment
392	 The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed
393	 The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950
394	 Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now
395	 These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena
396	
In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center
397	 Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort
398	 In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate
399	 This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes
400	
Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift
401	 This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class
402	” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision
403	” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for
404	”
The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful
405	 In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place
406	 Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification
407	 Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area
408	 This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood
409	 In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification
410	 For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place
411

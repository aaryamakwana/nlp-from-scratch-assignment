1	 Walking the Walk in Patagonia A dinosaur expert at Carnegie Museum of Natural History continues on a journey 25 years in the making

3	 It’s a walk with purpose, one where success is determined by many factors, some controllable, some not
4	 “I still to this day get fooled by fossil bones that look like rocks and rocks that look like bones,” says Matt Lamanna, the Mary R
5	 Dawson Associate Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History
6	 “The difference can be really subtle
7	 But then, other times, you walk up to a place and it’s just littered with bone fragments and teeth
8	” Lamanna, the museum’s chief paleontologist, has taken many of these walks—in Antarctica, Australia, China, Egypt, and Greenland, among other places—and found the remnants of multiple new dinosaur species
9	 This year, he returned to the place where his career essentially began: Patagonia, a region at the southern end of South America rich with dinosaur fossils
10	 “I get the question, ‘Why would you go all the way to Argentina?’” he says
11	 “‘It’s really far away
12	 Why would you go there when we have loads of dinosaurs right here in the U
13	S
14	?’” The answer is simple: Much less is known about dinosaurs from South America than those from Europe, Asia, and especially North America
15	 For the past 25 years, Lamanna and his Argentinian colleagues have worked to narrow this gap, and to better understand the last non-avian dinosaurs to have lived in Patagonia
16	 Argentinian scientists have been researching these kinds of dinosaurs for even longer
17	 Despite those efforts, much of the rocks there remain unexplored by paleontologists, making them ripe for new discoveries
18	 “In the limited time I have on this planet I want to make the most scientifically significant fossil discoveries I can
19	 I want to try to improve humanity’s knowledge of dinosaurs as much as I can,” Lamanna explains
20	 “In my mind, the most likely place to do that is in the Southern Hemisphere continents
21	” Lamanna’s first trip to Patagonia to work with a group of Argentinian researchers was in 1998, when he was still a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania
22	 He’s been back several times since, but this year he returned to a spot of special significance: the Estancia Laguna Palacios, a vast wilderness of exposed rocks and cliffs with fossil-bearing strata some 95 million years old
23	 It’s been 15 years since his last expedition there
24	 Matt Lamanna “In the limited time I have on this planet I want to make the most scientifically significant fossil discoveries I can
25	 I want to try to improve humanity’s knowledge of dinosaurs as much as I can
26	” – Matt Lamanna, Paleontologist at Carnegie Museum of Natural History “I have this weird mix of emotions,” he said, 29 hours prior to departing from his home just north of Pittsburgh in mid-February
27	 “The last time I was there I was 32
28	 I’m 47 now
29	 Do I still have what it takes to do this?” His 1998 trip to the Estancia Laguna Palacios was Lamanna’s first international dinosaur expedition, and one that was transformative for him, personally and professionally
30	 He developed deep friendships with the Argentinian paleontologists he worked with and began a scientific collaboration that has helped shape his career
31	 “We’re like brothers,” Lamanna said of his Argentinian colleagues
32	 “I’m very much a guest on their project
33	 I think I may add a little in terms of scientific expertise, I guess that’s why they keep inviting me back—though I think they might enjoy my company just a little bit, too
34	 Either way, it’s a privilege to be invited to do these kinds of things
35	” Two other associates from the museum—Kara Fikse and Linsly Church—joined Lamanna to document the journey, search for fossils, and help preserve any discoveries
36	 Every fossil discovered stayed in Argentina so scientists there could continue to study them
37	 Return Engagement The Estancia Laguna Palacios looked just the way Lamanna had remembered it
38	 “Estancia” translates to “ranch” in Spanish, and the terrain looks a lot like a sunlit surface of the moon—a barren, windy plain with jagged rocks, eroded buttes, and spires in an array of rose, slate, and burgundy
39	 The landscape is like Badlands National Park in South Dakota, but with rocks that are tens of millions of years older
40	 Located in the Chubut Province of Argentina, part of central Patagonia, the region has become well known among paleontologists for its dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous Period, the last period in the age of dinosaurs
41	 Most days began about an hour’s drive from the group’s hostel-like cabin in the village of Buen Pasto, where the teams slept in bunk beds and shared dinners after each day’s work
42	 The team’s campsite at Valle Joaquín, near the Río Chico headwaters, where they collected additional bones of a 70-million-year-old megaraptorid
43	 The primary mission was to uncover an elephant-sized, long-necked, plant-eating sauropod dinosaur known as a titanosaur
44	 Thanks to a discovery years prior, Lamanna and his colleagues knew there was part of a skeleton buried in the area, and they were going to try to recover it
45	 The titanosaur turned out to be much more complete than the researchers initially thought, preserving vertebrae from the neck, trunk, and hips, plus several large pelvic and limb bones
46	 But on the fourth day of the expedition, they stumbled on an unexpected find
47	 Lamanna, Fikse, and Church were revisiting a spot the team first canvassed on its 1998 trip where they discovered a probable new species of meat-eating dinosaur, called a megaraptorid theropod, although not enough of the specimen to be able to name it
48	 Known for their powerful forelimbs tipped by enormous claws, megaraptorids are still something of a mystery to paleontologists, who have yet to find a complete skeleton
49	 “It’s always been a little bit frustrating,” Lamanna admits
50	 They went back in 2000 to dig more and believed they had collected “everything there was to collect
51	” That the skeleton remained incomplete is not unusual
52	 Most of the time, when paleontologists discover a dinosaur, they don’t come close to finding the whole thing
53	 “It’s extraordinarily rare to find a dinosaur that’s even 75 percent complete,” he says
54	 “When you see these fully mounted skeletons in museums, even the best of them almost always have a few reconstructed parts
55	” Carnegie Museum of Natural History has one of the most extensive sauropod collections in the world, but even the best of those skeletons isn’t totally complete
56	 As a result, “our understanding of these dinos does often build up incrementally,” Lamanna says
57	 Titanosaur femur and tibia in a quarry
58	 The day of the unexpected find at the ranch was a sunny one
59	 Lamanna, Fikse, and Church walked along the same area, up a hillside, dispersing in a flat area against clementine-tinted cliffs
60	 They were exploring a group of rocks called the Bajo Barreal Formation, a fossilized ecosystem that preserves dinosaurs and other animals that lived in what’s now central Patagonia about 95 million years ago
61	 As the wind began to pick up, Lamanna noticed something half buried in the dirt
62	 “I think I was at the site for about a minute or less, and I looked down and I saw a small piece of bone sticking partly out of the ground,” he recalls
63	 “I realized right away it was part of a meat-eating dinosaur
64	 Given where this bone was found, and the anatomical appearance of the bone, it’s a virtual certainty it belonged to that same megaraptorid specimen we discovered 25 years ago!” Lamanna soon would identify his find as a foot bone, a piece of evidence that puts the team one step closer to being able to fully envision the dinosaur from the fossils they have and, eventually, name it
65	 “It was really wild to go back to a site that was so foundational for me, not only in my work in Patagonia but in a lot of my research since then,” he says
66	 “To come back a quarter century later and find another bone of this thing was absolutely unexpected because we thought we’d gotten it all
67	 We were really fired up
68	” History-Making Find By the final week, the expedition had already been deemed a success
69	 The team had made several key discoveries—including bones of three different dinosaur species—when two of the Argentinian scientists unearthed another history-making fossil
70	 The group had moved to a new area, the Río Chico headwaters, where the rock formations date back roughly 70 million years
71	 “We get these two brief windows into dinosaurs that lived about 70 and 95 million years ago, respectively, in this part of Patagonia,” Lamanna says
72	 They camped in a valley in the Río Chico region just in time for the most challenging weather of the trip
73	 Strong winds kicked up swirls of dust, which got everywhere—in tents, in sleeping bags, in socks
74	 Everyone wore ski goggles
75	 Gabriel Casal (right) and Matt Lamanna (center) make a protective plaster and burlap jacket around several bones of the new titanosaur skeleton at the Estancia Laguna Palacios
76	 On the first day of the Río Chico dig, two Argentinian students unearthed a Cretaceous-aged mammal fossil, the only one ever found in the region
77	 The students, Noelia Cardozo and Ivanna Mora, have been training in the lab led by paleontologists Gabriel Casal, Lucio Ibiricu, and Andrea De Sosa Tomas
78	 The unassuming fossil was an upper jawbone of a rodent-sized mammal containing at least four tiny teeth
79	 The whole fossil is only about the width of a thumbnail
80	 It belongs to a now-extinct mammal called a meridiolestidan
81	 During this time, mammals lived in the shadows of larger dinosaurs and so mostly remained comparatively small in size, Lamanna notes
82	 Sharing those discoveries with the rest of the world, even as the team was finding them, was Kara Fikse’s job
83	 Fikse, director of donor engagement and stewardship at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, documented the journey and facilitated live video streams viewed by hundreds of people across the U
84	S
85	, Canada, France, and Australia
86	 Kara Fikse The aim was to give the public a behind-the-scenes view of what it was like to be a dinosaur scientist
87	 She said that witnessing it firsthand was striking
88	 “Everyone’s face was streaked with dirt, everyone was just genuinely excited to be working together out there in the field,” Fikse recollects
89	 “And from the scientific aspect, whenever they found something, that sort of emotion of excitement and passion for the work they were doing was pretty contagious
90	” It was all a new experience for Linsly Church, curatorial assistant for vertebrate paleontology at the Museum of Natural History
91	 “This was an exciting opportunity to go on my first expedition and my first trip to Argentina,” Church says
92	 “I was looking forward to learning more about how fossils are found, stabilized, and removed from the ground
93	 It was a great experience and I got to meet and work with so many wonderful people!” Matt Lamanna and Linsly Church During the expedition she learned to apply plaster-soaked burlap strips over the fossils to protect them when they were uncovered, and helped to dig the trenches needed in order to extract each bone
94	 At the Río Chico, she found a toe bone of another new megaraptorid species that had been previously found at the site
95	 It was one of many discoveries, including parts of duck-billed dinosaurs and turtles, that made the expedition so successful
96	 The new mammal fossil discovered by the Argentinian students was especially groundbreaking
97	 “By itself, this fossil would’ve made our expedition a smashing success,” Lamanna exclaims
98	 “The fact that we also found parts of four different dinosaur species put it totally over the top
99	” International Collaboration Finding a dinosaur bone in the ground is only the first step in what is often a years-long journey in understanding what a fossil is and where it fits into the broader record of life on Earth
100	 This long and arduous adventure of fossil study and preservation begins in the lab
101	 In the middle of their Patagonia trip, the team decamped to the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia
102	 There, Lamanna and his Argentinian collaborators, including Lucio Ibiricu, study discoveries from the field
103	 Lamanna (left) and fossil preparator Marcelo Luna in the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia
104	 “We share a lot of ideas about papers and projects, so we are going to continue in this line,” Ibiricu says
105	 “We are sure that we are going to continue working with Matt for several years, sharing field seasons, papers, projects, and hopefully sharing students to increase their experience
106	” As investments in paleontology labs and student training in Argentina continue to grow, more discoveries will follow
107	 “By working together, the scientific impact we can make is potentially very significant,” Lamanna says
108	 Because of how Earth has evolved, Cretaceous dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere are usually quite different from their northern counterparts, having evolved along separate evolutionary pathways for tens of millions of years after the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart

116	 The museum’s collections are “alive and evolving,” she notes, as scientists investigate them to help us understand life on Earth

118	 She adds that, through the livestreams of their expedition, Lamanna and his colleagues were able to show that science isn’t just something that happens in a lab or at someone’s desk
119	 “It’s very much happening in the greater world around us, and there are many aspects of being a scientist
120	 “The whole time that they were in the field, they were connecting back with visitors here, through their live feeds, and really making science alive,” Baker says
121	 “That’s why we want to continue supporting scientists’ research and exploring their questions

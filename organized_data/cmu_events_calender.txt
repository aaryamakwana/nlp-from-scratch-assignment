Event Name: From the Ghetto to the Forest: Surviving the Holocaust in Belarus
Date: 2024-10-25 Noon - 1 p.m.
Location: Noon - 1 p.m.
Posner Grand Room, Posner Hall 340
Description: Eighty-one years ago, on October 21, 1943, the Minsk ghetto was “liquidated’’—German forces rounded up the last remaining Jewish prisoners and either killed them in the surrounding forest or deported them to concentration camps further west. A group of 13 Jews, however, survived in the basement of a home in the city and saw the end of World War II. This group’s survival testifies to the brutal force of the murder campaigns in and around the ghetto.
It also demonstrates the agency Jewish children, youngsters, women and men developed in the face of marginalization, abuse and horrific violence and which enabled them to survive, in hiding or as part of so-called partisan units that gathered in the forests and swamps around Minsk and many other Belarusian cities and towns.
Anika Walke’s current research looks at the long aftermath of the Nazi genocide in Belarus. In particular, she is interested in how people remember and live with the effects and repercussions of systematic violence. She has recently taught courses on the Holocaust and the history of the Soviet Union and will join the CMU History Department in fall 2025 as the inaugural Askwith Family Professor.
Sponsored by the Department of History, The Jack Buncher Chair in Jewish Studies, and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Date: 2024-10-25 3 - 4:30 p.m.
Location: 3 - 4:30 p.m.
Hamburg Hall, A301
Description: The advent of generative AI has raised a new wave of concern about what the rapid pace of automation will mean for workers who have already made substantial investments in skills. While workers can develop skills throughout their careers, what strategies will enable them to find sustainable labor market success? How can workers start their careers to maximize long run success?
The Block Center for Technology and Society, in partnership with the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, is convening experts at the cutting edge of this research for a two-part, one-day conference. The first session is an invitation-only, academic mini-conference of paper presentations by key experts. This second session is open to the campus community, local policymakers and the public to convey the state of knowledge on this topic and to foster interactions between stakeholders and academic researchers.
Our goal is to push forward this conversation on how a skilled workforce can keep pace with the rapid technological advancement across industries. Experts will be announced soon!

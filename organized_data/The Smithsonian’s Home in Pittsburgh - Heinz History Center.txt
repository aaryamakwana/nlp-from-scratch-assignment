18	 1864 (base added in 1878)  
The first gun built using the Rodman hollow casting process was made at the Fort Pitt Foundry in the 1850s
19	 In 1860, the War Department commissioned Rodman to build the world’s first 15-inch cannon
20	 By 1864, Rodman had also supervised the fabrication of a massive 20-inch gun
21	 This model depicts the specialized intricate casting apparatus used in making the first 20-inch Rodman, which required nearly 80 tons of molten iron poured from three furnaces
22	 A complex four-piece mold was required to shape the cannon, which was cast in an upright position
23	 The completed 20-inch gun barrel, one of six made at the Fort Pitt Foundry, weighed 117,000 pounds
24	 This model educated West Point Military Academy cadets on the casting techniques pioneered in Pittsburgh

In the days when there were few regulations for radios, Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, built a makeshift studio in his garage and played records over the airwaves
27	 His supervisor at Westinghouse, Harry P
28	 Davis saw Conrad’s hobby as a great way to sell more radios, and they applied for the first commercial radio license
29	 On October 27, 1920, they received the call letters KDKA and set up a small studio in Westinghouse’s East Pittsburgh Works
30	 On November 2, KDKA broadcast the election results between Harding and Cox, credited as the first commercial radio broadcast

1	 Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village
2	 The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives
3	 Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection
4	 This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs
5	 Our Story The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania
6	 In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history
7	 Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years
8	 Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people
9	 In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce
10	 Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections
11	 The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public
12	 In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary
13	 These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today
14	 Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives
15	 In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd
16	 In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District
17	 With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania
18	 The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution
19	 The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions
20	 Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission
21	 In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue
22	 The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage
23	 Heinz History Center As Pittsburgh’s “people museum,” the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the world’s oldest jeep
24	 Plan your visit Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center’s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions

29	 In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years

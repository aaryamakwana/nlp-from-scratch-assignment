10	 APP BACKGROUND Pittsburgh Opera launched our mobile app in 2016, to provide patrons with easy access to information about our productions, artists, and events
11	 The app is powered by Instant Encore , the leading provider of mobile solutions to performing arts organizations around the globe
12	 In the fall of 2018, Instant Encore began offering its customers a premium feature within its platform called Live Note ®
13	 Created by the Philadelphia Orchestra in partnership with Drexel University’s Expressive and Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center , LiveNote® initially delivered visual content (e
14	g
15	 text and photographs) to patrons during orchestra performances
16	 Pittsburgh Opera began carefully testing this functionality during our fall 2018 performances of Madama Butterfly and Hansel & Gretel 
17	 Pre-selected audience members served as beta testers and provided positive feedback on their experiences
18	 Thanks to an Innovation Grant from OPERA America funded by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation , Pittsburgh Opera partnered with Instant Encore to add real-time audio capabilities to LiveNote®
19	 We began testing these capabilities in January 2019 at our performances of afterWARds – Mozart’s Idomeneo Reimagined , and continued testing throughout the remainder of our 2018-19 season
20	 Great care had already been taken to ensure the app would not disrupt nearby patrons
21	 After our 2018-19 season ended, Pittsburgh Opera and Instant Encore added additional safeguards to minimize light seepage and reduce the risk of incoming phone calls startling users
22	 With these additional safeguards in place, we publicly rolled out the functionality at the beginning of our 2019-20 season
23	 We will continue to monitor and adjust the app over time

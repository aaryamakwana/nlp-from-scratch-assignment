42	org General Reporting Principles All complaints are investigated promptly, thoroughly, and objectively
43	 Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent practical and permitted by law
44	 Investigations will be conducted as confidentially as possible and related information will only be shared with others on a need-to-know basis
45	 Those involved in such investigations are required to be truthful, accurate, and cooperative throughout the investigation process
46	 Those who report misconduct are known as complainants
47	 Those against whom a complaint is lodged are known as respondents
48	 Complaints should be as detailed as possible and include a description of the complained of conduct, the names of all individuals involved as well as any witnesses, and the dates on which the complained of conduct occurred
49	 If discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment, will be taken
50	 CMP may also report conduct to law enforcement, as appropriate
51	 Initial Assessment The Coordinator will conduct an initial assessment of any reported conduct
52	 As part of the assessment, the Coordinator will, among other things: consider the expressed resolution preferences by the reporting party; assess the circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct; address any immediate physical and emotional safety concerns; notify the reporting party of their right to contact law enforcement if warranted by the circumstances; provide the reporting party with information about the procedural options available under this policy; assess for pattern evidence by the respondent; and explain CMP’s policy prohibiting retaliation
53	 Following the initial assessment, the Coordinator will determine whether this policy is implicated and whether an informal or formal resolution is appropriate and articulate those conclusions to the complainant
54	 CMP strives to assess, investigate, and resolve all reports of potential misconduct under this policy within sixty (60) days
55	 Resolution and Investigation Procedures Informal Resolution CMP’s informal resolution process aims to appropriately investigate and, if necessary, address alleged misconduct without requiring a formal resolution process described below
56	 Under an informal resolution process, a complainant reports alleged misconduct under this policy to the Coordinator
57	 The Coordinator will give notice to the respondent of the alleged misconduct and may gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent
58	 At their discretion, the Coordinator may gather additional information by meeting with relevant witnesses (identified by either the Coordinator or the complainant and respondent) and collecting any evidence, including correspondence between the parties
59	 Each party may be heard throughout the informal resolution process
60	 CMP strives to complete any informal resolution process within thirty (30) days; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations
61	 Following an investigation, the Coordinator may or may not then impose sanctions or other disciplinary action as appropriate
62	 Neither party may appeal an informal resolution once final
63	 Formal Resolution If the Coordinator deems a formal resolution to be appropriate, CMP will begin the formal resolution process described in this sub-section
64	 CMP strives to complete any formal resolution process within sixty (60) days excluding any appeals; however, the timeline may be longer due to the complexity of the allegations
65	 During an investigation, both complainants and respondents may have an appropriate advisor who may observe any hearings or interviews as well as provide support, guidance, and advice during an investigation
66	 The Coordinator will begin or continue an investigation by providing written notice to each party that an investigation has begun and will also appoint an investigator
67	 The appointed investigator may be a CMP Coordinator that will not formally adjudicate the complaint or external appointed investigator appointed at CMP’s sole discretion
68	 The appointed investigator will gather necessary facts by interviewing the complainant and respondent
69	 At their discretion, the investigator may conduct other fact-finding by meeting with relevant witnesses and gathering any evidence, including correspondence between the parties
70	 Each party is entitled to be heard throughout the investigation process
71	 Following the investigation, the investigator will submit a written report summarizing the facts and outlining areas of agreement and disagreement between the parties
72	 The report may redact irrelevant or prejudicial information as necessary
73	 The Coordinator will then share the report with each party, allowing them time to review
74	 A party has five (5) days to review the report and submit responses for consideration into the final report
75	 Once a report is finalized, the investigator will determine whether the respondent is responsible for the alleged misconduct
76	 The investigator will use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard and inquire whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of misconduct
77	 Upon this determination, the investigator will recommend adjudicatory action and sanctions to the Coordinator, including, but not limited to: a warning letter, suspension, expulsion, termination, or a no contact order
78	 The Coordinator will then formally adjudicate through a written letter to each party notifying them of the outcome
79	 Either party has the right to appeal the adjudicatory action letter submitted by the Coordinator
80	 A party must appeal the letter in writing within ten (10) days and must state one of three limited grounds: 1) a procedural error which materially affected the outcome of the investigation; 2) the existence of new information unavailable to the investigators during the investigation which could have materially affected the outcome; or 3) the recommendation of the investigators and/or adjudicatory action taken by the Coordinator was clearly erroneous based on the evidence gathered during the investigation
81	 Appeals must be heard by an Appeal Officer
82	 The Appeal Officer may be any Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator not involved in the original proceeding
83	 The Appeal Officer will review the findings of fact, investigation record, investigator recommendations, and adjudication letter to determine whether the appealed decision should be affirmed or reversed
84	 The Appeal Officer must submit a written determination within fifteen (15) days of an appeal

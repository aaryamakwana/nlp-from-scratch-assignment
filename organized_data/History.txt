12	(more)  Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century
13	 A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City
14	” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping
15	 The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire

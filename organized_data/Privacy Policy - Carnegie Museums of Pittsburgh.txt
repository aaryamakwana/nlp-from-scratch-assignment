27	 To the extent you voluntarily make any sensitive data available through the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree that such data may be processed by Carnegie Museums as necessary to provide the Services in accordance with your instructions
28	 Information Collected Automatically There are areas of the Sites where Carnegie Museums or our service providers may automatically collect certain data as you use the Sites and navigate elsewhere online, such as your IP address and other data about your Internet connection, your operating system, browser type, and other services or equipment you use to access the Sites, and usage data about your interaction with our Sites

33	 Cookies can be used to track usage patterns, trends and visitor behavior, as well as to record other information regarding your visit
34	 These cookies may allow us to share information with our trusted advertising partners which enables us to present you with retargeted advertising on third-party web sites and/or social media platforms based on your previous interactions with our Sites
35	 Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can change the preference on your browser to reject them
36	 Doing so however, may affect your ability to use certain features of our Sites
37	 We may also use third-party analytics providers which could automatically collect certain Personal Information and other data about you through the Sites including, but not limited to, your IP address and/or other online identifiers
38	 Third-party cookies or other tracking technology may be used through this process to track data such as the times you most frequently use the Sites, what devices you use to access the Services, what parts of the Services you visit and the links you use to get there
39	 These data and analytics service providers may use such information to track how you use the Services, measure the performance of the Services, improve features on the Services, and provide Carnegie Museums with tools that satisfy overall operating needs for the Services
40	 Carnegie Museums may then use feedback from these service providers to improve the Services and our interactions with you
41	 All of the above-referenced IP addresses and other data will be collected in an automated manner and we may maintain that information or associate it with certain other data, which may include Personal Information you provide voluntarily through the Services
42	 This helps us improve our Services, deliver better and more personalized Services, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and store information about your preferences

76	 Carnegie Museums is required to try to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Information
77	 If you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity
78	 For most other requests, Carnegie Museums will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Information we store about you before responding to your request
79	 If more information is needed to verify your identity in certain situations, Carnegie Museums may deny your request or ask for more details as necessary to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure and deletion
80	 We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you
81	 Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, nor does it guarantee that we will be able to process your request
82	 We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request
83	 The Carnegie Museums reserve the right to refuse any request made regarding your Personal Information if we are unable to process the request for any reason, such as if we are unable to verify the identity of the person making the request or if we cannot authenticate the legitimacy of the request using reasonable efforts
84	 Carnegie Museums is under no obligation or duty to verify the legitimacy of any request regarding Personal Information
85	 Any removal of content by Carnegie Museums does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the content in all places
86	 The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information

88	 Therefore, please be as specific as possible in your request
89	 If the request relates to information Carnegie Museums needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Services properly moving forward

94	 The Sites are not currently configured to respond to “do not track” or similar automated privacy controls
95	 To learn more about ways to possibly opt-out of certain kinds of tracking that occur when you browse the Internet generally and may lead to targeted advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site and the Digital Advertising Alliance web site 
96	 Options you select are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee that these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising
97	 As noted previously in this Policy, it is possible that certain third parties may receive information through the Services
98	 Since some of these third parties may respond differently than Carnegie Museums to “do not track” requests, you should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information

111	 These may include retention periods that are: (1) mandated by law, contract or similar obligations that apply to Carnegie Museums’ operations; (2) for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or (3) needed to maintain adequate and accurate organizational records

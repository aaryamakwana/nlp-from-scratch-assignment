18 Overview of the Government of the City of Pittsburgh
The government of the City of Pittsburgh is composed independently elected and appointed officials who work 
alongside more than three thousand employees in the service of advancing the interests of City residents
7938	 The 
Mayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote
7939	 City Council’s nine representatives are elected to 
office by residents in each of their respective districts
7940	
The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or 
fraudulent practices
7941	 Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with 
reporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City’s fiscal condition
7942	 Every 
year, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information 
on Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook
7943	
City Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City
7944	 This body also 
approves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital 
Budgets
7945	 City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of 
City government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole
7946	
City Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk
7947	 The 
City Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information 
resource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh
7948	 The City Council Budget 
Division monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations
7949	  It prepares and distributes 
to Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City 
of Pittsburgh
7950	 It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special 
reports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations
7951	
The Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly 
responsible for much of the City’s daily operations
7952	 This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices, 
Bureaus, and Commissions
7953	 The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to 
debt management
7954	 Many of these departments focus on specific services
7955	 For example, the Department of Law 
acts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments
7956	 Two units act as umbrella 
organizations
7957	 The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire, 
Emergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and 
Safety
7958	 Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations, 
Environmental Services, and Facilities
7959	
Additionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial 
hierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City’s General Fund
7960	 For this reason, these 
Authorities are not included in the Operating Budget
7961	
A comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart 
presented in this document
7962	 City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide
19 What is the Operating Budget?
The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year
7963	 Reported within this document are 
figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year
7964	 Expenditures are 
spread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices
7965	 These expenditures represent costs for the 
administration and distribution of governmental services
7966	 These services include, but are not limited to: public 
safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and 
programming for local parks and community recreation centers
7967	 In addition, the General Fund also supports the 
routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’ 
compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service
7968	
The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents
7969	 Revenues are 
collected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses, 
charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other 
revenue generating mechanisms
7970	 
The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what 
governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal 
year
7971	 The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in 
delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed
7972	
The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and 
Members of City Council
7973	 Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the 
City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses
7974	 As a result, the City of 
Pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire 
through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms
7975	 Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must 
prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the 
City
7976	 The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits 
priorities set by the City’s elected public officials
7977	
Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document
7978	 All of the costs incurred by the City of 
Pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget
7979	 Therefore, the 
City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document
7980	 The Operating 
Budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial 
creation of the plan

The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh 
recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid
7982	
The Fiscal Year
The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of 
each year
7983	 This can only be changed by ordinance
7984	
Balanced Budget Mandate
The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues 
equal to or greater than estimated expenditures
7985	 Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, 
the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance

20 The City’s Fund Structure
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on 
a fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary
7987	
 Governmental Funds
General Fund
Capital Projects Fund
Community Development Funds
Special Revenues Funds
Fiduciary Funds
Pension Trust Fund
Agency Funds
The General Fund  is the main operating fund for the City
7988	 It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain 
most of the City’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general 
administration
7989	
The Capital Projects Fund  is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or 
program (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to 
provide a long-term benefit to the City
7990	 All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum 
value of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years
7991	 Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from 
three major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds
7992	 For more detail on 
the Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document
7993	
Community Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD)
7994	 These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and 
human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households
7995	
Special Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or 
committed for a specific purpose
7996	 Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership 
Fund, and the Grants Fund
7997	 While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for 
two of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund
7998	 Although many of these include the word 
“trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the 
funds are not held by any trustees or custodians
7999	
 
Fiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government
8000	 These 
resources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature
8001	 The 
City’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund
8002	
• The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for 
firefighters, and a third for municipal employees
8003	
• Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax 
refunds
8004	 The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other 
Post-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of 
Fiduciary Funds
8005	
Budget Allocations
This budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that 
comprise the government of the City
8006	 Individual divisions carry out unique tasks
8007	City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget

What Are the City's Sources of Revenues?
Annual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources
8032	 There are seven subclasses
8033	
 Revenues
41  Tax Revenue
42  License and Permit Revenue
43  Charges for Services
44  Fines and Forfeitures
45  Intergovernmental Revenue
46  Interest Earnings
47  Miscellaneous Revenues
Tax Revenue
Taxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues
8034	 In addition to wage and property taxes, there are 
many that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City
8035	 
They are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate
8036	
Real estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue
8037	 The City collects them on behalf of the City, School 
District, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
8038	 Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within 
the City of Pittsburgh
8039	 Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property 
Assessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property
8040	 As of 2023, the City real estate 
tax rate is 8
8041	06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10
8042	25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax 
rate is 0
8043	25 mills
8044	 Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny 
County Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000)
8045	
Other sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax, 
the Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the 
Deed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax
8046	 
Earned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn 
wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year
8047	 City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2 
percent School District tax
8048	 Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security, 
and capital gains are commonly excluded
8049	
The Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied 
at the rate of 0
8050	55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed 
individuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide 
services within the City of Pittsburgh
8051	 Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax
8052	City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide
23 Finally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of 
Pittsburgh
8053	 A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051
8054	
In 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76
8055	5 percent of total City revenue
8056	
City of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0
8057	50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for 
the improvement of the City's parks
8058	 These funds are not deposited into the General Fund
8059	 Please see the Stop 
the Violence Trust Fund  section for more information
8060	
Non-tax Revenue
“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not 
directly involve the levying of taxes
8061	 Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction 
permits and liquor and malt beverage licenses
8062	 However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as 
interest earnings on investments, that are less visible
8063	 Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue 
for the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees
8064	
Each year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of 
grants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed
8065	 For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account 
consists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt
8066	 Most 
intergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid
8067	 Local 
entities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal 
agencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue
8068	 In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the 
quality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden
8069	 
Many City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged
8070	 Examples of these fees 
include payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale 
of rights of way
8071	 In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and 
governmental entities
8072	 For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to 
receive medical care
8073	
In 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23
8074	5 percent of total City revenue
8075	
How Does the City Spend Money?
The tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents 
ranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets
8076	 Expenditures are monitored by 
department or division and by subclass
8077	
Major expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City 
of Pittsburgh employees
8078	 The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past 
and current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs
8079	 The chart 
below illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) 
contributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation

82101  Interest Expense - Bonds
82103  Principal
Budget Creation Process
The operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations, 
policy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions
8089	 OMB also holds public meetings, as required by 
City Code
8090	
After receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit 
proposals
8091	 Each division presents budget proposals to OMB
8092	 These proposals include current year achievements, 
requests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes
8093	 The Mayor reviews the 
proposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if 
any, should be funded
8094	
The Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September
8095	 OMB hosts additional public meetings to 
garner feedback
8096	 If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made
8097	 When the proposals and the Mayor’s 
strategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November
8098	
City Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division
8099	 After 
consideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a 
vote to adopt the budget
8100	 This must occur before December 31st
8101	  Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of 
the new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to 
collective bargaining agreements) pay any employees
8102	 The last time a budget was not approved before 
December 31st was 1931
8103	  
Upon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating and 
Capital Budgets
8104	 Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City’s expenditures and revenues, provides 
legislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments
8105	 
Analysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure 
categories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important 
management initiatives
8106	City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide
26 Five-Year Financial Forecast
In addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both 
expenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year
8107	 Together, these estimates comprise 
the five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document
8108	
The five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time
8109	 This 
aids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-
term impact on City operations
8110	 In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for 
long-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might 
result in a financial impact
8111	 The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus 
ensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh
8112	
Revenue Forecast
Revenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and 
deliver services to City residents
8113	 The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the 
rights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
8114	 
Projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections
8115	
The Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts
8116	 
Previous years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues
8117	 Monthly and end-of-
year financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) system
8118	 This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue 
line
8119	 Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line
8120	
In addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic 
variables
8121	 These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue 
generating activity in the City
8122	 The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the 
National Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs
8123	
Revenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of 
Pittsburgh’s Operating Budget
8124	 The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are 
developed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are 
reasonable
8125	 Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections 
are finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast
8126	
Expenditure Forecast
OMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast
8127	 To develop these 
forecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software
8128	 These known 
expenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension 
contributions, etc
8129	) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc
8130	)
8131	
OMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and 
initiatives
8132	 While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are 
subject to growth in future years
8133	 These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market
8134	 This 
is accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,
Lastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described 
above
8135	 These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in 
achieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department
8136	 OMB compiles all such requests 
and evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives
8137	 Subject to available funds, those requests that 
fall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast

Five-Year Expenditure Forecast
The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan submitted by the City highlights the Mayor's commitment to 
financial sustainability, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, and strengthening 
financial management practices
8649	 The City plans to achieve these by:
• Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services
• Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations
• Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and 
provide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases
• Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary
The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and 
improve the City’s long-term fiscal health by:
• Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated 
minimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC)
• Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 10
8650	1 percent of General 
Fund expenditures in 2024
• Allocating a $22
8651	0 million in "pay-as-you-go" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan
In addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key 
components and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following:
• Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase 
workplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost 
management initiative
8652	
• Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees, 
workers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer 
contributions to the pension fund
8653	 Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few 
years, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget 
Fiscal Year 2024 Expenditures
53 health and managing costs
8654	 Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension 
funding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment
8655	
• Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required 
costs that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across 
each department
8656	 
• Debt Service: The forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in 
2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City’s critical infrastructure 
needs
8657	
• PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the 
Capital Projects Fund each year
8658	 PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on 
capital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds
8659	 In the 2024 Capital 
Improvement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement, 
economic development, and blight remediation
8660	 The forecast assumes that the City will continue to 
contribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing 
$22 million in 2024 and a total of $21
8661	1 million from 2025 to 2028
8662	
Most non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout 
fiscal year 2028
8663	 Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027

The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan achieves substantial improvements in terms of the percentage of 
total expenditures related to debt service
8665	 In fiscal year 2015 expenditures related to debt service reached 
$89,289,167
8666	 This represented 18
8667	6 percent of total budgeted expenditures
8668	 In the 2024 Operating Budget, total 
planned expenditures related to debt service is $69,390,272, or 10
8669	1 percent of total budgeted expenditures
8670	 This 
trend illustrates the City’s commitment to long term financial health
8671	 The long term impact of this plan will allow the 
City to responsibly borrow at more favorable rates, comply with the City’s debt policy, and provide resources to 
invest in the City’s assets

Community Health 
and Safety
194 195 Mission
 
The mission of the Office of Community Health and Safety is to  improve community safety and well-being, and 
support public safety personnel by building a public health-informed response continuum
9429	 
Departmental/Bureau Overview 
The Office of Community Health and Safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing 
sustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to Public 
Safety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response
9430	  Through partnerships and program development, 
the Office will focus on:
Developing a Continuum of Support:  Through continued collaboration with first responders and community 
members, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and 
evaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of 
resources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public 
Safety partners
9431	  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis 
will be utilized to build this continuum
9432	
Implementation of Public Health-Informed Practices:  Public Safety personnel consistently respond to 
community needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders 
have significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being
9433	  OCH&S will work with 
the Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and 
responses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by 
community members
9434	  Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate 
translational experiences
9435	
Consistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and 
accountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the 
current response continuum
9436	  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, 
prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth
9437	  OCH&S will 
partner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and 
may not engage in traditional meetings
9438	  Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives 
focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism
9439	
Note: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund

239 Citizen Police 
Review Board
240 241 Mission
The Independent Citizen Police Review Board ("CPRB") promotes responsible citizenship and respectable law 
enforcement through mutual accountability
9734	  The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide 
independent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police
9735	  To accomplish this assignment, the Board 
will thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations; 
evaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices 
through public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor 
and Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures
9736	
A Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the 
staff and determines all final dispositions of cases
9737	 The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and 
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review
9738	
Departmental/Bureau Overview
Investigation and Complaint Disposition  - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the 
CPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises
9739	 Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake 
Coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of 
the complaint
9740	 The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the 
complaint
9741	 The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a 
preliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator
9742	 The Assistant Executive Director provides 
daily supervision and oversight of case investigations
9743	 Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and 
the results are presented to the Board
9744	  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an 
investigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint
9745	 Complaints may proceed through 
investigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion
9746	  Findings and recommendations resulting from public 
hearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board
9747	  Patterns emerging from 
complaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy 
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor
9748	
Community Education  - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens 
and police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and 
civilian expectations of police conduct
9749	  Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and 
personal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s 
role and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship
9750	  The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the 
public is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen 
and the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as 
offensive
9751	  The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the 
process, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort
9752	
Board and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance, 
including police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human 
rights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior
9753	  Staff training 
is designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops 
mediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills
9754	 Staff adheres to the standards 
and performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals
9755	
Administrative - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board 
and those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board
9756	  Activities 
of this core service include the planning, organization, development, evaluation, and implementation of efficient 
and effective management strategies of fiscal, personnel, information systems, and related support to maximize 
the utility of the resources available
9757	 The Assistant Executive Director facilitates daily administrative 
communication and serves as liaison to the administrative departments of the City

287 Grants Office
The City of Pittsburgh’s Grants Office is situated within the Office of Management and Budget and is tasked with 
centralizing the City’s grant-seeking efforts as well as providing guidance and oversight to City departments in 
managing their post-award grant administration and reporting processes
10089	
The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City’s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate, 
and foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through 
closeout
10090	 The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, 
and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars
10091	
The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to 
expand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City’s Operating and Capital budgets
10092	 Grant 
funds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our 
community
10093	 These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain 
technological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment
10094	 Grant funds are dispersed 
throughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, 
recreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others
10095	 Because grant funding allows 
the City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the 
impact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant
10096	
In 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding
10097	 Some projects 
supported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding 
to rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield 
Bridge supported by a State grant award

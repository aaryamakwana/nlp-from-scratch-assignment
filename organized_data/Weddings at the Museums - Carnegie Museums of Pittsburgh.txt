Colleen & Eric could not have been happier the way things turned out and that’s what really matters

25	  Everything from the spacious layout of the tables and chairs to the presentation of the glassware at each table to the depiction of the cookie table was done to perfection!  You helped realize our dream, and for that we are incredibly thankful!

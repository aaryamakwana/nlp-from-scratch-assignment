3	 For the first time, you can easi­ly see all kinds of data about Pitts­burgh—includ­ing 311 re­quests, build­ing permits, code violat­ions, pub­lic safe­ty in­ci­dents, city assets, and public records on every par­cel in the city
4	 But City data isn’t a log of when and where we put our park­ing chairs
5	 It’s a huge col­lect­ion of in­form­ation about the world a­round us that can help us under­stand what’s happen­ing in our neigh­bor­hoods, and lead us to ideas and decis­ions that can make where we live bet­ter
6	 We think of it as neb­by for the great­er good
7	 So, whether you’re look­ing at in­form­at­ion about side­walks that need re­pair­ing, or map­ping out street­lights that are a lit­tle too dim, re­mem­ber: While data can help us know, its high­est pur­pose is to help us join to­get­her with other re­sid­ents and the City to make change
8	 Ok, so how do I use it? Burgh’s Eye View uses maps to visualize data generated by the City of Pittsburgh and its residents
9	 As you play with it—changing the date range, for example—what you see on the map will change
10	 You can scroll to zoom or use the +/- buttons at the top left, click on pins to see details, and move the map around using a mouse or touch
11	 Currently, three general map types are available: maps of points, places and parcels
12	 Points The points map shows data located at specific points in the city, such as public safety incidents, 311 requests, code violations, capital projects, and city assets
13	 Search You can search for a specific address or block, as well as other keywords in some of the data
14	 But keep in mind that a lot of location information is generalized to the block or neighborhood level in order to protect people's privacy
15	 Some sensitive datasets don't have addresses at all, and so will not react to address searches
16	 Dates Most information on the Points map has a date attached to it
17	 Change the date range to see things from a certain day, week, month, or any period you’re interested in
18	 Data Using these checkboxes, you can turn off datasets to get a clearer view of what you're interested in
19	 Some datasets have specific filters just for them
20	 You can set those filters in the fields below each checkbox
21	 311 Requests This layer allows you to see 311 requests , which are non-emergency concerns or questions that residents send to the City using the 311 call center, social media , text message, the website , or the myBurgh apps for iOS or Android 
22	 As you can imagine, residents have a wide range of concerns and questions
23	 Start typing in the “Request Type” box to select the types of requests you want to see on the map
24	 You can also view requests that are assigned to specific City departments or agencies, and view requests by origin (whether they were submitted as a call, on social media, etc)
25	 Click any of the orange icons on the map to learn more about a specific 311 request Public Safety Information These layers allow you to see incidents captured in the 30-day police blotter , the police blotter archive as well as non-identifying information on arrests and non-traffic citations 
26	 Use the Hierarchy field to find specific types of crimes
27	 Click on any of the blue, red, or pink icons on the map to learn more about a specific public safety incident
28	 Building Information These layers allow you to see information on violations and city facilities 
29	 Select or start typing in the “Violation,” “Inspection Result,” “Next Action,” or “Facility Usage” fields to narrow down or view specific results
30	 Click on any of the blue, green, or gray icons on the map to learn more about a specific permit, violation, or facility
31	 "Filter by Area" Are you interested in looking at information for a particular neighborhood, Council district, Police zone, or Public Works division? Select the type of area you want to see—the default is Neighborhood—and then you can set the specific area or areas below that
32	 As with Search, some datasets' locations are generalized and may not react to these filters
33	 Also, if you like videos, check out these how-tos produced by our Cable Channel: Introduction and Overview Use Case: Public Safety Downloading Data Places The Places map allows you to view a wide range of City assets, including bridges and recreation space, steps, pools, historic districts, flood zones, traffic signals, and more
34	 Search You can search for data in a specific neighborhood, as well as other keywords in some of the data
35	 Data Using these checkboxes, you can turn off datasets to get a clearer view of what you're interested in
36	 Some datasets have specific filters just for them
37	 You can set those filters in the fields below each checkbox
38	 Traffic Signals The traffic signals section includes some terms that may be new to our users
39	 “Actuated” means that the timing of a signal is determined by the number of vehicles detected at an intersection
40	 “Actuated ped” means that the pedestrian button must be pushed to activate the signal timing for pedestrians; “fixed per” means that a pedestrian button does not need to be pushed
41	 “Fully actuated” means that the signals are controlled by sensors, cameras, or radar
42	 Parcels The Parcels map allows you to view, at the neighborhood level, delinquent properties, City-owned properties, and properties in a tax abatement program
43	 You can also view information about any specific parcel, including type of owner, property class, sale information, county land value, and potential liens
44	 Some information, including the owner’s name, is not included in order to protect people's privacy
45	 While data on properties that are tax delinquent, in a tax abatement program, or city-owned comes from the City of Pittsburgh, all other data on the Parcels maps comes our partners at Allegheny County
46	 "Filter by Neighborhood" Are you interested in looking at information for a particular neighborhood? Select the neighborhood you want to see—the default is the Central Business District
47	 Search You can search for specific parcels in the chosen neighborhood by entering in the parcel's ID
48	 However, the search feature also allows you to search for things like address, owner code, and use code
49	 Individual Parcels Once you’ve selected the neighborhood you’d like to see, or entered the Parcel ID, you can click on any of the parcels to see information about that property
50	 Wait, why are things where they are? Markers or “pins” for each dataset show up on the map differently depending on the source
51	 Public Safety pins are geocoded by the block or intersection of the incident or arrest using Allegheny County's geocoder, every night
52	 Code violations are geocoded at the center of their respective parcel, which is determined by Allegheny County
53	 311 Requests are first geocoded by the City's 311 request tracking system
54	 To maintain citizens' privacy these requests are then specially obfuscated
55	 This process is handled by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center , and they describe it this way: For some less-sensitive request types, actual coordinates appear in the 311 open data
56	 For more sensitive requests, coordinates representing the approximate location of the complaint are shared to protect the identity of the person making the complaint
57	 The data file indicates whether exact or approximate coordinates have been included
58	 Wow, is there more like this? Whenever possible, Burgh’s Eye View will point you to other resources for the data or information you are viewing
59	 This includes links to the Allegheny County Real Estate Portal , the 311 Request Online Form , and the City Online Facility Rental page
60	 All of these resources are available 24/7, just like Burgh’s Eye View
61	 This page has lots of links to other City data, information and resources, and you can find more at pittsburghpa
62	gov or by following the city on Twitter and Facebook 
63	 And yes there are more projects like this to come! You can write to the team that built this at analytics@pittsburghpa
64	gov 
65	 We'd love to hear your feedback, ideas, and hopes for the future of data in the City of Pittsburgh
66	 (But please note that we may not be able to respond individually
67	) Burgh’s Eye View is an initiative of the Department of the Innovation & Performance ’s Analytics & Strategy Team
68	 We work under the vision and leadership of Mayor Bill Peduto, who has from day one been committed to being transparent and open with City data

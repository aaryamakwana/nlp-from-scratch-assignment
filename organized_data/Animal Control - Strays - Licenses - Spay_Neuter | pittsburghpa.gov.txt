1	 Love Your Wild Neighbor Public Service Announcement Video Baby Fawns Public Service Announcement Video Coyotes Public Service Announcement Video Love Dogs & Cats Public Service Announcement Video Description of Services: The Bureau of Animal Care & Control provides assistance to Bureaus within the Department of Public Safety, other City Departments and the Allegheny County Health Department in situations involving animals, both domestic and wild
2	 The Bureau enforces City and State codes dealing with animals; issues citations and appears in court; helps to keep our City’s parks animal-nuisance free; works with non-profit animal shelters; provides consultation to other municipalities concerning animal issues; and assists the Pennsylvania Game Commission in tracking the rabies virus
3	 Animal Care & Control Officers capture stray animals, assist in pet/owner recovery, resolve neighbor disputes over animals, assist the elderly and physically-challenged with animal concerns, advise and teach residents of their responsibility as pet owners, advise non-pet owners of their rights, and assist in the removal of nuisance wildlife
4	 Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks
5	 The Bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the District Attorney's office with humane investigations
6	 Although Animal Care & Control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly
7	 Many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the City has with a local animal shelter
8	 Due to the wooded mountainous geography of our City, residents share common areas with a host of wildlife (skunks, raccoons, ground hogs, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, etc
9	) Learn more about how to share space with wildlife by visiting our Living with Wild Life page

27	 Responsible pet owners need to know that along with the obligation to properly feed, shelter, and care for a pet, there are laws (ordinances) to protect the animal, the pet owner, and the community
28	 "Owner" includes every person who keeps or shelters and every person who allows an animal to be on their property (land or house) which is occupied by him or her
29	 This means that if you are in possession of an animal, whether you own it or not - you're responsible for its care, behavior, and welfare

for employees to  complete

working more hours than anticipated
1503	 He is paid weekly
1504	 Is his employer responsib le for 
withholding the LST now?  
ANSWER: Yes
1505	 After the employer realizes that the employee will  earn  $12,000  or 
more, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch -up then  
$1
1506	00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of  $52
1507

1508	 Employee has two part -time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year 
and another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year
1509	 Does this person need to  
pay the  LST?  
ANSWER: No
1510	  The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate w ith both employers

1519	 An individual works January thru June in the City and July thru December in Municipality 
“A”
1520	 He earns $10,000 a month at both jobs and is paid once a week

remit $26 along with his other employees’ deductions to the City
1522	 Municipality “A” would 
be entitled to the LST for the 2nd half of the year
1523	 The emp loyee should provide proof of 
LST paid for the first half of the year to Municipality “A”
1524	   -7-  6
1525	 An individual works July thru December in the City
1526	 He did not work January thru June, 
anywhere
1527	 He earns $10,000 a month
1528	 Does he owe the $52 LST to t he City?  
ANSWER: Yes
1529	 His employer knows that this employee is over  the  $12,000  low  
income exemption level
1530	 No exemption certificate has been filed
1531	 The $52 may be 
prorated for the rest of the year; however the employer should withhold $52 because that  
is what  the employee  owes
1532	  
SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the 
prior periods that were missed
1533	 This payroll deduction should also include the current 
payroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for

once a week, h e would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be 
deducted from one paycheck
1535	  
7
1536	 An employee has 2 jobs and both are part time
1537	 Both started at the beginning of January
1538	 
Job #1 is in the City and pays the employee $1,000 a month
1539	 Job #2 is in Municipality “A” 
and paid the taxpayer $500
1540	 Where should the tax be  paid?  
ANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the 
most should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City
1541	 The LST 
shoul d be paid to the City
1542	 The employee should file an exemption certificate with 
Municipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City
1543	  
8
1544	 On January 1, an employee worked for an employer in Municipality “A” and paid $10
1545	 In 
June the emplo yee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job
1546	   
Is the employer  required  to withhold  the LST from the employee?  
ANSWER: Yes
1547	 The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid) 
if the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”
1548	 Then the 
employer must pro -rate the $42  based on the remaining payroll  periods
1549	  
SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the 
prior periods that  were missed
1550	 This payroll deduction should also include the current 
payroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for
1551	 For example, if he is paid 
once a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be 
deducted from one p aycheck
1552	  
9

1554	 The employer has already withheld $52
1555

1557	 It is 
permissible and recommended that his employe r refund the current year LST and make 
an adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year
1558	  
If the employer does not refund the LST, the employee can apply for a refund from the 
City after the employer’s fourth quarter paymen t and summary form is filed at the end of

withholding the LST now?

and another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year

income exemption level
1530	 No exemption certificate has been filed

deducted from one paycheck

1537	 Both started at the beginning of January
1538

1539	 Job #2 is in Municipality “A” 
and paid the taxpayer $500
1540	 Where should the tax be  paid?  
ANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the 
most should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City
1541	 The LST 
shoul d be paid to the City
1542	 The employee should file an exemption certificate with 
Municipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City
1543	  
8

1545	 In 
June the emplo yee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job
1546	   
Is the employer  required  to withhold  the LST from the employee?  
ANSWER: Yes
1547	 The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid) 
if the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”
1548	 Then the 
employer must pro -rate the $42  based on the remaining payroll  periods
1549	  
SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the 
prior periods that  were missed
1550	 This payroll deduction should also include the current 
payroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for
1551	 For example, if he is paid 
once a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be 
deducted from one p aycheck

1557	 It is 
permissible and recommended that his employe r refund the current year LST and make 
an adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year

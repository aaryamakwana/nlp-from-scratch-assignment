33	 Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding
34	 She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha
35	 She also has secretly converted to Christianity
36	 The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony
37	 Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in
38	 He curses her, inciting the crowd
39	 Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away
40	 Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her
41	 As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet
42	 Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant
43	 His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future
44	 In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him
45	 Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again
46	 Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American
47	 Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori
48	 Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal
49	 She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return

52	 She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms
53	 As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night
54	 Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed
55	 In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny
56	 Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate
57	 As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest
58	 Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive
59	 Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly
60	 Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away
61	 Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate
62	 She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness
63	 She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him
64	 Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away
65	 She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide
66	 As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears
67	 Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him
68	 She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself
69	 As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly

6	 We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions
7	 We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers
8	 We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company
9	 CAPTIONING/SUPERTITLES All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage
10	 These are sometimes referred to as "OpTrans"
11	 AUDIO COMMENTARY Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory
12	 Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory
13	 Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes
14	 A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003
15	 Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices
16	 Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the "pre-show"
17	 Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the "play-by-play"

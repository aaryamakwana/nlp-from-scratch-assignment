2359	  
 
(a) Rate  of tax
2360	 A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is hereby  imposed  upon  each  
parking  transaction  by a patron  of a non-residential  parking  place  at the rate of 
thirty -seven  and one-half (37
2361	5)  percent  for all transactions  occurring  on or after 
January  1, 2009
2362	  The rate of tax may be changed  for any tax year by the 
legislative  actions  of the Mayor and City Council
2363	   However, the tax rate may not 
exceed the rate permitted by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and 
Recovery Act , 53 P
2364	S
2365	 § 895
2366	902
2367	  
 
(b) Calculation  of tax
2368	 The following  method  must  be used  to compute  the tax, 
whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  
individual  tax collections  are not kept for each  ticket :  
 
Simplified Calculation 
2369	  For ease of administration and tax collection,  the tax 
return presumes that gross collections include both total consideration from the 
patron and collected parking tax  from the patron 
2370	 Under this simplified 
calculation the applicable tax rates is 27
2371	273% times gross collections
2372	  
 
 The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as follows:  
 
Parking  Fee X Tax Rate  = Parking  Tax Due 
 
For example,  where  the tax rate is 37
2373	5%:  
 
$1,000
2374	00  X 37
2375	5%  = $375
2376	00  
$1,550
2377	00  X 37
2378	5%  = $581
2379	25  
 
(c) Calculation  of total  payment
2380	  The following  method  shall be used  to compute  
the total payment  collected  by the  operator  and paid by the  patron,  whether  the tax 
total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are 
not kept for each  ticket
2381	  The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as 
follows:  
 
Parking  Fee + Parking  Tax = Total  Payment  
 
For example,  where  the tax rate is 37
2382	5%:  
$1,000
2383	00  + $375
2384	00  = $1,375
2385	00  
$1,550
2386	00  + $581
2387	25  = $2,131
2388	25  
 
(d) Calculation  of total  payment where  there  is a surcharge
2389	  The following method  
shall be used  to compute  the total payment  collected  by the operator  and paid by 
the patron  when  a surcharge  is imposed,  whether  the tax total is taken  from 
individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each  
ticket
2390	  The parking  tax will be applied  to the sum of the base  parking  fee and the 
surcharge
2391	  The rate of  tax is defined above  and will be applied  as follows:  
  -11-  (Base  Fee + Surcharge)   + Tax Rate(Base Fee  + Surcharge) = Total  Payment  
 
For example,  where  the tax rate is 37
2392	5%  and the surcharge  is $10: 
($1,000
2393	00  + $10
2394	00)  + $378
2395	75  = $1,388
2396	75  
($1,550
2397	00  + $10
2398	00)  + $585
2399	00  = $2,145
2400	00

§ 301
2358	  RATE  OF TAX
2359	  
 
(a) Rate  of tax
2360	 A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is hereby  imposed  upon  each  
parking  transaction  by a patron  of a non-residential  parking  place  at the rate of 
thirty -seven  and one-half (37
2361	5)  percent  for all transactions  occurring  on or after 
January  1, 2009
2362	  The rate of tax may be changed  for any tax year by the 
legislative  actions  of the Mayor and City Council
2363	   However, the tax rate may not 
exceed the rate permitted by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and 
Recovery Act , 53 P
2364	S
2365	 § 895
2366	902
2367	  
 
(b) Calculation  of tax
2368	 The following  method  must  be used  to compute  the tax, 
whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  
individual  tax collections  are not kept for each  ticket :  
 
Simplified Calculation 
2369	  For ease of administration and tax collection,  the tax 
return presumes that gross collections include both total consideration from the 
patron and collected parking tax  from the patron 
2370	 Under this simplified 
calculation the applicable tax rates is 27
2371	273% times gross collections
2372	  
 
 The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as follows:  
 
Parking  Fee X Tax Rate  = Parking  Tax Due 
 
For example,  where  the tax rate is 37
2373	5%:  
 
$1,000
2374	00  X 37
2375	5%  = $375
2376	00  
$1,550
2377	00  X 37
2378	5%  = $581
2379	25  
 
(c) Calculation  of total  payment
2380	  The following  method  shall be used  to compute  
the total payment  collected  by the  operator  and paid by the  patron,  whether  the tax 
total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are 
not kept for each  ticket
2381	  The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as 
follows:  
 
Parking  Fee + Parking  Tax = Total  Payment  
 
For example,  where  the tax rate is 37
2382	5%:  
$1,000
2383	00  + $375
2384	00  = $1,375
2385	00  
$1,550
2386	00  + $581
2387	25  = $2,131
2388	25  
 
(d) Calculation  of total  payment where  there  is a surcharge
2389	  The following method  
shall be used  to compute  the total payment  collected  by the operator  and paid by 
the patron  when  a surcharge  is imposed,  whether  the tax total is taken  from 
individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each  
ticket
2390	  The parking  tax will be applied  to the sum of the base  parking  fee and the 
surcharge
2391	  The rate of  tax is defined above  and will be applied  as follows:  
  -11-  (Base  Fee + Surcharge)   + Tax Rate(Base Fee  + Surcharge) = Total  Payment  
 
For example,  where  the tax rate is 37
2392	5%  and the surcharge  is $10: 
($1,000
2393	00  + $10
2394	00)  + $378
2395	75  = $1,388
2396	75  
($1,550
2397	00  + $10
2398	00)  + $585
2399	00  = $2,145
2400	00

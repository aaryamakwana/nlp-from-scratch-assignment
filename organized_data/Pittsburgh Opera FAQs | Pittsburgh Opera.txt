4	 Have a question that’s not asked or answered here? Feel free to give us a call at 412-281-0912 during office hours
5	 How much do tickets cost? Click here to explore season ticket options 
6	 How long will the opera be? You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under " Details and Resources 
7	" What's a good show for opera newbies this season? Typically first-timers like to start with classics like The Barber of Seville (coming this October, 2023) or La Traviata (coming March, 2024) at the Benedum Center
8	 They've got famous and familiar music, fantastic casts, traditional sets and costumes, and, well, that grand-opera grandness that so many people love
9	 The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson (coming April, 2024) may also be up the newcomer's alley, presenting a slice of Pittsburgh history with the familiar music of Carmen 
10	 You'll understand every word with the English texts projected above the stage
11	 Is it OK to bring kids to the opera? Of course! Opera is fun for the whole family
12	 We have kids who come to our student matinees and then make their parents come back so they can see the show again
13	 The main thing is that your child should be able to sit quietly for long periods of time
14	 Third or fourth graders are usually fine, but parents are the best judge
15	 Pittsburgh Opera sells tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 for half-price, to make it easier for you to expose them to this wonderful art form
16	 Some operas – OK, most operas – have adult themes
17	 Murder, revenge, lust – all that stuff that grown-ups find so interesting
18	 Kids do best if you prepare them in advance
19	 Tell them the story of the opera, play some of the music, or watch a few videos on YouTube 
20	 Have your little Warhols and Cassatts draw pictures of their favorite characters or imagine what the set might be like
21	 Be creative! Is there any special etiquette I should know about? A little common courtesy is all you need
22	 It probably bothers you when people talk and rattle their candy wrappers at the movies, or talk on their phones, or show up late, or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show
23	 If something is considered poor form at the movies, it's probably poor form at the opera too
24	 If you’re not sure when to clap, just wait until everybody else does
25	 If you really like what you hear, yell, “Bravo!” Or just cheer! Is Pittsburgh Opera still performing at the Benedum Center? Yes! Our mainstage productions are at the Benedum Center
26	 Our 2023-24 season features The Barber of Seville , The Flying Dutchman , and La Traviata at the Benedum Center live and large on the grand stage
